This personal monorepo aggregates active packages, learning projects, and archived work into one workspace dedicated to ongoing experiments and tooling (`README.md:1`). It standardizes development with a Bun-managed TypeScript toolchain, using commands like `bun install`, `bun run build`, `bun run test`, and `bun run typecheck` to manage dependencies, builds, and quality gates (`README.md:56`). The `scripts/run-package-script.ts` automation enumerates every package beneath `packages/*` to execute requested scripts while honoring skip lists, giving the repo a consistent, centralized way to run tasks across the workspace (`README.md:34`).
