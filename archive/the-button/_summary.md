This project is a full-stack application consisting of three components: **app**, **web**, and **api**. The **app** directory likely contains a mobile client, possibly built with React Native or Flutter; the **web** directory contains a web frontend, probably built with React, Vue, or another JavaScript framework; and the **api** directory implements a backend—likely using Node.js/Express, Python/Django, or a similar server framework—which serves data and handles authentication for both clients. Together, these components provide a responsive and scalable application architecture supporting both web and mobile platforms.
