This project consists of a core backend module and a web frontend module. The backend (core) is likely implemented in a language such as Python, Java, or Node.js, handling business logic, data processing, and possibly API management. The frontend (web) provides a user interface, most likely built with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which interacts with the backend to deliver a complete application experience.
