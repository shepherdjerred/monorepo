This package automates turning Markdown study notes (`book_high_performance_web_applications.md`, `book_ostep.md`, `bytes.md`, `interview.md`) into Anki decks by invoking the mdanki CLI to emit `.apkg` files. The `generate.sh` workflow relies on Node.js tooling (`npx`, `mdanki`, `sql.js`) plus a shared `settings.json` template that defines the card HTML and CSS, and it swaps in the `sql-memory-growth.js` build of sql.js before running the conversions so every deck is generated with the memory-growth WebAssembly runtime.
