Starlight Karma Bot is a Discord bot that manages karma points, leaderboards, and history commands for servers. It runs on Bun with discord.js v14, TypeORM backed by SQLite, dotenv/env-var configuration helpers, and Sentry instrumentation declared in `package.json:1`. The data layer uses TypeORM view entities and an auto-migration routine to keep per-guild stats consistent, combining definitions like `src/db/karma-counts.ts:1` and the legacy migration in `src/db/auto-migrate.ts:1`.
