This monorepo centralizes the author’s active projects, learning experiments, and archived work under a shared Bun toolchain that exposes repository-wide build, test, and typecheck commands. It runs on Bun-managed TypeScript workspaces defined in `package.json:1`, integrating tooling such as Tauri APIs, Lefthook git hooks, and Dagger’s TypeScript SDK for automation. The repository relies on `scripts/run-package-script.ts:1` to traverse every package directory and execute the requested script while honoring the `SKIP_PACKAGES` exclusion list, giving the workspace a consistent orchestration layer.
