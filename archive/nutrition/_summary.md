This project is a data analysis tool that parses Apple Health data using a Python script (`apple-health-data-parser.py`). It is built with Quarto for creating interactive reports (`index.qmd`) and uses a Python virtual environment managed by Pipenv (`Pipfile`, `Pipfile.lock`). The configuration files (`_quarto.yml`, `_publish.yml`) control the Quarto rendering and publication process, allowing the results to be published as a website or report.
