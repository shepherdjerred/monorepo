This project, "harding-christmas," is a Node.js web application that provides a countdown to Christmas for Harding University. It uses Express as the web server and incorporates Bulma for styling, as well as several Webpack loaders and plugins for asset handling and build optimization. Frontend functionality relies on the "countdown" library, and the build process leverages tools such as css-loader, file-loader, and cssnano for CSS and file management.
