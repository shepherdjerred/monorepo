This project is a basic web server written in Rust, designed for concurrent handling of HTTP requests. It uses Rust's standard library for TCP networking, implements a custom thread pool for managing incoming connections, and modularizes configuration, request handling, and multithreading within separate modules. The server listens on localhost at port 8080 by default and demonstrates core principles of scalable, multi-threaded network programming in Rust.
