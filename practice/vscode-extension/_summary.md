This project is a Node.js-based JavaScript/TypeScript application, configured with ESLint for code quality and built using esbuild, as evident from the presence of esbuild.js and associated configuration files. It likely includes VS Code extension quickstart guidance and is set up with a TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json), but currently has no declared runtime dependencies. The structure is suited for development, linting, and packaging of a library or application.
