Instalike is a Node.js automation script that logs into Instagram and likes or comments on every post for a specified target account. It relies on the `instagram-private-api` client along with Bluebird for promise control flow and Underscore utilities, all wired via a simple `node index.js` entry point. The script maintains session cookies on disk and uses a Bluebird `mapSeries` loop to page through the user media feed sequentially, checking prior comments before posting new ones.
