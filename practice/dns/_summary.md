This Rust project models DNS protocol data structures and currently emits a greeting when run. It uses the Rust 2021 toolchain with the `packed_struct` crate to define bit-precise DNS headers, questions, and related fields. By deriving `PackedStruct` for nested types such as `Message` and `Header`, it enables big-endian serialization of DNS components without manual byte handling.
