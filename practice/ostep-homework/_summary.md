This repository hosts the OSTEP homework suite that reinforces operating systems concepts through chapter-aligned exercises and simulators. The exercises rely on Python scripts such as `cpu-intro/process-run.py` alongside x86 assembly snippets in `threads-locks/*.s` to model CPU scheduling, virtualization, and synchronization scenarios. Each simulator supports repeatable experimentation by letting learners generate unlimited problem instances via random seeds and solve them automatically with the `-c` flag.
