Harding Christmas is a display app for Harding University’s DormNet that counts down in real time to both the annual lighting ceremony and Christmas Day. The project bundles a Bulma-styled Sass frontend with countdown.js and particles.js animations via a Webpack 2 build, serves the bundle through an Express static server, and uses client logic to switch the title and target date from the November 26 lighting event to December 25 once the ceremony time passes.
