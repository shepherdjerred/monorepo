Webring aggregates the latest items from user-defined RSS feeds, implemented in TypeScript with dependencies like rss-parser, remeda, sanitize-html, and truncate-html to fetch, transform, and sanitize entries. It supports an optional cached execution path that stores results on disk via zod-validated configuration, enabling per-source preview filters and shuffle controls before returning the final list.
