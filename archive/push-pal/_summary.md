This project appears to be a monorepo managed in a workspace structure (as indicated by the presence of the `packages` directory and `push-pal.code-workspace` file), utilizing the Earthly build system (Earthfile) for automation and Docker-compatible builds. Dependency management and updates are automated with Renovate, as configured in `renovate.json`. The overall aim and technical approach, with supporting documentation in README and ROADMAP files, suggest a modern, modular development workflow leveraging containerization and automated CI/CD practices.
