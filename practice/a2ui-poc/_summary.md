The project delivers an AI-powered knowledge exploration agent that emits structured A2UI protocol messages to drive interactive surfaces for user queries. It is built in TypeScript with Bun tooling and depends on `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, `ai`, `hono`, and `zod` for AI integration, routing, and schema handling. The `KnowledgeAgent` streams Anthropic output, strips Markdown fences, and parses newline-delimited JSON to yield UI updates using the A2UI message builders.
