This repo bundles command-line tools to import a Monarch Money transaction CSV and explore spending patterns and subscriptions. The scripts are written in TypeScript for the Bun runtime and use `bun:sqlite` against a local SQLite database built by `archive/monarch-money/csv-to-sqlite.ts:1`. Subscription detectors such as `archive/monarch-money/find-subscriptions.ts:7` and `archive/monarch-money/find-yearly-subscriptions.ts:7` run layered SQL CTEs that compute variation coefficients and cadence scores to surface active monthly and yearly recurring charges.
