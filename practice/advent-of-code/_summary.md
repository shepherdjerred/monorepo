This personal monorepo consolidates active projects such as the `clauderon` session manager for AI coding agents, spanning tooling, docs, and archived work (`README.md:1`, `packages/clauderon/Cargo.toml:1`). It uses a Bun-managed TypeScript workspace with shared scripts and Tauri integrations alongside Rust crates that pull in Tokio, Axum, SQLx, Ratatui, WebAuthn, and gRPC support to deliver async services, terminal UIs, and desktop capabilities (`package.json:1`, `packages/clauderon/Cargo.toml:13`). A notable architecture detail is the repository-wide `scripts/run-package-script.ts` runner that orchestrates build, test, lint, and typecheck commands across every package directory to keep the multi-package structure consistent (`scripts/run-package-script.ts:1`).
