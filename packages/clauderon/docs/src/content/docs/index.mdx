## Why clauderon?

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Zero-Credential Security" icon="shield">
    AI agents run with placeholder credentials. Real tokens are injected by the
    proxy at request time, keeping secrets out of agent memory.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Multiple Backends" icon="rocket">
    Run sessions in Docker containers or Zellij terminal sessions. Choose the
    isolation level that fits your workflow.
  </Card>

  <Card title="TUI Interface" icon="laptop">
    Full terminal user interface for creating, managing, and interacting with
    agent sessions.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Git Integration" icon="github">
    Automatic git configuration injection. Sessions inherit your git identity
    for seamless version control.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Install

```bash
# Download the latest release
curl -fsSL https://github.com/shepherdjerred/monorepo/releases/latest/download/clauderon-linux-x86_64 -o clauderon
chmod +x clauderon
sudo mv clauderon /usr/local/bin/

# Start a session
clauderon
```

## Architecture

clauderon uses an HTTP proxy with TLS interception to securely manage credentials:

1. **Session Creation**: Create isolated environments (Docker/Zellij)
2. **Proxy Configuration**: Sessions route traffic through clauderon's proxy
3. **Credential Injection**: OAuth tokens injected at request time
4. **Request Filtering**: Malicious requests blocked before reaching APIs

This architecture ensures AI agents never have direct access to your credentials.
