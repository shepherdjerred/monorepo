This project implements a multithreaded Rust HTTP server that listens on 127.0.0.1:8080 and serves basic requests with hard-coded configuration. It relies on Rust 2018 with only the standard library (for example `std::net::TcpListener` and a custom `ThreadPool`) to parse requests and craft responses. Notably, it uses a manually built thread pool to dispatch incoming TCP connections across worker threads for concurrency.
