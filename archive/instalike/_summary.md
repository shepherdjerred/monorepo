This project, Instalike, is a Node.js automation tool that uses the instagram-private-api, bluebird (for Promises), and underscore libraries to interact with Instagram programmatically. It logs into Instagram, retrieves recent posts from a target account, and comments on posts that the user hasn't yet commented on, choosing a random comment from a preset list. The project structures authentication using cookie storage for session persistence.
