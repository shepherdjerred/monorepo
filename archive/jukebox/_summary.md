This project, "jukebox," is a Rust application designed to control music playback on Sonos devices and Spotify. It uses the sonos crate for Sonos device discovery and control, and the rspotify crate (with CLI support) for interfacing with the Spotify Web API, handling authorization via credentials read from a local TOML file. The code is asynchronous, leveraging Tokio for async runtime, and configurations/credentials are handled using Serde and toml parsing.
