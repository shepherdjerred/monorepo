This project is a minimal operating system kernel written in Rust, targeting the x86_64 architecture and designed to run in a bare metal (no standard library, no OS) environment. It uses the `bootloader` crate for booting, `x86_64` for architecture support, `spin` for synchronization primitives, and `uart_16550` for serial communication, with unit testing supported in QEMU. The code demonstrates low-level system programming in Rust, including custom panic handling, test infrastructure, and output to serial/console with a focus on safety and concurrency primitives usable without the Rust standard library.
