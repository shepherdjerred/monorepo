Containerized toolkit for fine-tuning GPT-2 on Amazon SageMaker, exporting checkpoints back to S3 for endpoint deployment. Uses Docker, Python, Flask, the gpt-2-simple library, and SageMaker’s filesystem conventions wired into `src/sagemaker.py`. It centralizes both training hyperparameter management and inference generation in a single image, exposing a Flask `/invocations` API that streams prompts through `gpt2.generate` on the preloaded TensorFlow session.
