This project is an AWS Lambda application written in Python, structured using the AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) framework. It leverages AWS services for serverless deployment, and the configuration files provided (template.yml, samconfig.toml) define the Lambda resources, API Gateway setup, and deployment parameters. The code resides in the src directory, enabling streamlined packaging and deployment of serverless functions.
