 - We are going to create some types for a deck of cards
 - The cards need to have an ordering, based on the standard ranking http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck#Rank_and_color
 - We are assuming Aces are high.
 - Therefore, the following statements should be true:
 -  (Card Ace Spades) > (Card King Spades)
 -  (Card Two Clubs) < (Card Three Clubs)
 -
 - We are going to provide our own implementation of the Show typeclass for the Card type.
 - When displaying the Card instance in GHCI, or calling show (Card digit suit), the String which should be displayed is "The <Digit> of <Suit>"
 -
 - Uncomment the following declarations to complete the implementation, and provide an implementation for instance Show Card
 -}

data Suit = Clubs | Diamonds | Hearts | Spades deriving (Eq, Ord, Enum, Bounded, Show)
data Digit = Ace | One | Two | Three | Four | Five | Six | Seven | Eight | Nine | Ten | Jack | King | Queen deriving (Eq, Show, Ord, Enum, Bounded)
data Card = Card { digit :: Digit, suit :: Suit } deriving (Eq, Ord, Bounded)

instance Show Card where
  show (Card digit suit) = "The " ++ (show digit) ++ " of " ++ (show suit)

-- We should be able to provide a function which returns the higher ranked card:
betterCard :: Card -> Card -> Card
betterCard x y
  | x < y = x
  | otherwise = y

-- Here is a new Typeclass, which represents some kind of playing hand in a game.
-- It returns True for a "winning hand", depending on the rules for the type of class we are playing with
class Hand a where
  play :: [a] -> Bool

-- Implement Hand for Card, where play returns true if the list contains the Ace of Spades
instance Hand Card where
  play c = elem (Card Ace Spades) c

-- Create a new Coin type
data Coin = Heads | Tails deriving (Eq, Show, Ord)

-- Implement Hand for Coin, where play returns true if there are ten heads in a row in the list
instance Hand Coin where
  play c = elem (replicate 10 Heads) (subsequences c)
