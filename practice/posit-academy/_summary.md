This project is an R-based data analysis workflow, structured as a series of milestones (milestone_1.R through milestone_4.R) and an R Markdown extension (extension_4.Rmd). It leverages R for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and reporting, using R scripts for sequential processing steps and R Markdown for documentation and result presentation. The project is organized to guide users through systematic data analysis, from initial processing to advanced extension and reproducible reporting.
