This project implements the Birmel Discord bot that runs on the Bun runtime to automate guild interactions and AI-driven responses. It leverages concrete technologies like `discord.js`, `@ai-sdk/openai`, `@prisma/client`, `@opentelemetry/sdk-node`, and `@sentry/node` for messaging, language models, data access, telemetry, and monitoring. A notable architecture detail is the global Prisma client singleton that reuses the database connection across modules to keep the bot responsive.
