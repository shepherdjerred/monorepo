This project is a simple 2D game or visualization prototype built in Rust using the Bevy game engine (version 0.4), with integration of the bevy_tiled_prototype plugin for loading Tiled map assets. It demonstrates a basic scene setup with camera and character movement controlled by keyboard input, sprite rendering, and on-screen performance diagnostics. The code leverages Bevy’s ECS (Entity Component System), asset loading, and plugin systems for modular game development.
