This Node.js utility enumerates Harding University EASEL classes by programmatically crawling class identifiers. It runs with dotenv-driven configuration and leverages request-promise-native, tough-cookie, jsdom, and loglevel to handle authenticated HTTP requests and HTML parsing. It maintains a reusable cookie jar and halts the scan after detecting multiple nonexistent classes to avoid unnecessary traffic.
