This project is a Python web scraper that uses requests, BeautifulSoup, and regular expressions to extract ice cream flavor information from the Frankie & Jo's website blog/news section. It crawls multiple news pages, locates URLs related to flavor announcements, and parses visible text content for further processing. The code is organized for modular crawling and extraction of flavor names and descriptions.
