# Siphon Vue

## About

Siphon is a better way to navigate Harding's Pipeline website. It has a far superior search interface, and a much more cleaner, modern design. It can be accessed [here](http://www.hu-siphon.com/#/)

Originally, Siphon was made to embed Harding's webpages into the main content part of the site using iFrames. Harding's IS&T department expressed great displeasure at this idea, so it has since been reworked so that Siphon simply links to Pipeline rather than embeds it.

Because of IS&T not approving this project, it is no longer worked on.
