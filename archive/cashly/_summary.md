This project provides a monorepo that delivers a React web UI alongside shared core logic and CLI tooling. It uses TypeScript throughout, with React and react-scripts in `web`, and enforces consistency via ESLint configured with @typescript-eslint, Promise, Jest, Import, Node plugins plus Prettier formatting. Its package-level separation (`core`, `web`, `cli`, `mono`, `concept`, `assets`) enables cross-package module reuse under unified linting and formatting rules.
