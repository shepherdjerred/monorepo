This project is a documentation generation toolkit designed for Node.js and Express.js applications. It leverages custom files and modules (such as `docblocs`, `docblocs-demo`, `docblocs-test`, and `express-docblocs`) to parse and generate API documentation directly from annotated source code. Built with JavaScript, it integrates easily with Express.js servers to provide live or static documentation for RESTful APIs.
