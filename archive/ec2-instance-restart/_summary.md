This project provides AWS Lambda handlers that start, stop, or list a specific EC2 instance through a shared request processor. It relies on boto3 for EC2 control alongside jsonschema validation and DiscordWebhook notifications to enforce input structure and broadcast operation results. A single `handle_request` workflow in `src/common.py` routes operations defined by the `Operation` enum, giving the Lambda functions a unified orchestration layer.
