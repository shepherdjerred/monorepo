The project implements a RESTful API for managing clubs and meetings, providing authenticated CRUD endpoints for club membership and meeting scheduling. It is built with Node.js, Express routing, Mongoose models backed by MongoDB, and JWT configuration defined in `api/src/config.js`. Club routes centralize data access by using an `router.param` middleware to preload the club document and populate members before controller handlers run.
