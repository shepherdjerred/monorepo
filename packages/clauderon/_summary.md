Clauderon is a Rust-based session management system tailored for AI coding agents, enabling users to create, manage, and interact with coding agent sessions via command line or a terminal user interface (TUI). It leverages asynchronous programming (Tokio), terminal management (ratatui, crossterm, pty-process), persistent storage (SQLx with SQLite), and structured command-line parsing (clap), providing extensible backend options (like zellij or Docker) for session orchestration. The system supports operations such as session creation, listing, attachment, archiving, and deletion, and includes a daemon mode with optional HTTP API services.
