Hello 2021, we are so happy you are here!
We are welcoming the new year the best way we know how, with three incredibly delicious ice creams that are completely sweetened by dates, coconut sugar, and maple syrup. We love creating ice creams at Frankie & Jo’s that are sweet, creamy, and satisfying while also being a mindful choice for your body. 
 

BANANA BREAD: An ultra-creamy coconut oat milk ice cream that is blended with ripe, roasted bananas and swirled with gooey house-made roasted date caramel. Each bite tastes like freshly baked banana bread slathered in creamy butter. CHOCOLATE SUPERCAKE: The most decadent chocolate ice cream with generous pieces of fluffy supercake, made with superfoods chaga and maca, covered in plant-based chocolate buttercream frosting. We promise you, this flavor will blow your mind. TOCOCCINO: Rise & Shine! Back for the second time, this creamy coffee ice cream that is sweetened only with coconut sugar and maple syrup.

Hello, December. 
The most wonderful time of the year is here! Filled with twinkling lights, the smell of fresh-cut trees, and cozy nights in -- however you celebrate this season, we would love to take part.
This month our three seasonal flavors are inspired by some of our favorite winter beverages: The creaminess of oatnog, the warmth and vitality of a mocha espresso, and the sweet nostalgia of a cup of hot cocoa topped with fluffy marshmallows and a peppermint. We hope these ice creams bring extra magic to your holiday season.
 
OATNOG: Frankie & Jo’s twist on that classic holiday drink is back! Meet your new favorite ultra-creamy oat and coconut milk ice cream loaded with cinnamon and nutmeg. VITA VALENCIA: Inspired by Caffe Vita’s new drink Valencia, we created a magical combination of espresso, orange, oats, and chocolate. We steep Caffe Vita Del Sol espresso and orange zest in our coconut oat milk base. Pieces of our house-made crunch bar, made from crispy rice cereal and dark chocolate, are folded throughout. The perfect combination of crunch, citrus, coffee!WHITE CHOCOLATE PEPPERMINT: Not much is better than a warm cup of hot chocolate with fluffy marshmallows on a cold winter day. So, we had to make it the F&J way. White chocolate peppermint ice cream is swirled with pink marshmallow fluff and peppermint cookie dough bites. Pure magic in every bite.
 
All flavors are available today through January 5th, online and in our scoop shops. 



Take a deep breath. Feel the crisp autumn air in your lungs and release an exhale full of gratitude. 

November is always a month dedicated to thankfulness and celebration here at Frankie & Jo’s. Especially after what this year has brought us, and as we approach our fourth birthday, we are over the moon of how our plant magic community has continued to support our mission to radically shift the way you think about ice cream. So, these flavors are dedicated to you and packed full of seasonal traditions, gooey swirls, and delicious baked goods.

For the month of October, we are taking a journey into the celestial space of dreams. In partnership with Stephanie Gailing, astrologer and author of her new book, The Complete Book of Dreams. 
 
"This month is capped off by an illumination-inspiring Blue Moon, offers us myriad opportunities to access powerful insights that can enhance our well-being. One way we can connect to greater clarity, and live our lives with more confidence and consciousness, is to turn to the wisdom inherent in our dreams. Under the Night Sky, as sleep showers us with renewal, our Dream State offers us a landscape that unearths buried treasures of stellar awareness."
- Stephanie Gailing 
 

 

Our ice creams, inspired by the night sky and the two full moons in October, truly take us to the magical world of the deep dream state. 
 
Blue Moon: An homage to the Blue Moon occurring on October 31, this playful blue chamomile-infused ice cream reminds us to engage with the energy that accompanies a full moon. Dyed blue with spirulina, swirled with vanilla lavender marshmallow fluff and sprinkled with pieces of soft, chewy mochi pillows, this ice cream is light and nostalgic yet dreamy and complex. Dream State: This ultra-creamy pistachio ice cream is truly a dream come true. Rich in melatonin and nutrients that may enhance our sleep and dreams, pistachios are the star of this salty, nutty coconut-oat base. To finish, we sprinkle in pieces of salty pistachio almond fudge throughout. Night Sky: When the sky turns dark, and the stars reveal themselves, the illumination of dreams occur. We’ve created the darkest chocolate ice cream swirled with dark chocolate sauce and perfectly chewy chocolate cookies which embodies that dark night sky, the perfect canvas for your dreams. 
 
Find Stephanie's book available everywhere on October 20th. 
All three flavors are now available for nationwide delivery and in our Seattle scoop shops in scoops and pints through November 3rd. 


Welcoming September. 
A time of bittersweet goodbyes to long, warm summer days and tender hellos to cooler, shorter golden autumn days. As the days transition, so do our daily patterns. Our September flavors are created to bring solace and magic during this winsome season of change. The spiced smell of freshly made apple butter, the beloved richness of a chocolate hazelnut spread, and the ever-lasting bit of summer in tart, sweet huckleberry jam.
 All The Trees: This F&J’s fall favorite is back - a celebration of trees. Apple, pecan, bay, coconut, and cacao are all the trees whose fruits, leaves, nuts and seeds are represented in this ice cream. We make a rich house-made apple butter and swirl buttery pecan shortbread cookies throughout this bay leaf ice cream to perfectly encapsulate autumn in a scoop. 
Gianduja Crunch: Inspired by the ever-delicious and beloved Italian chocolate hazelnut spread, Gianduja(pronounced “jaan-doo-ya”). We make our own gianduja using Oregon-grown Freddy Guys hazelnuts and Theo 70% dark chocolate. This luscious chocolate ice cream is perfectly balanced with a gianduja swirl and pieces of candied hazelnuts sprinkled throughout for that much desired crunch.
Mountain Berry Magic: The season of the glorious huckleberry is here! We are honoring the beauty of this tart wild mountain berry by creating a stunning huckleberry ice cream in our coconut oat base, with huckleberries from Forged and Found Edibles. With swirls of gooey huckleberry jam and golden pie crust crumbles folded throughout, a scoop of this simply sings of the magical autumnal season approaching.
All flavors available in our scoop shops and online starting today through October 7. 



August is a time of sweetness 
in the Pacific Northwest. It's warm, easy days slowly waning to the autumnal season soon approaching. Stone fruit trees are gracing us with so many varieties of sweet-fleshed, brilliant-skinned fruits. The berries are plentiful, brimming with antioxidants, asking to be eaten by the handfuls or in our case, paired with cream and homemade fluffy layered biscuits. We are also in a time of great uncertainty, faced with challenges that are stretching and opening our minds daily. We hope our August flavors will remind you of the sweet ways to tend to yourself and your community in this last month of the summer season – find peace in a sun-ripened plum, rejuvenation in vitamin-rich raspberries, and calm in collagen and almond butter.
 

 
Peachy Plum: This is one of the very first flavors we developed back in 2016, and is a favorite amongst our team and customers. We blend super ripe local Collins Family Orchard yellow peaches and Cloud Mountain Farm Center plums into our coconut milk base to create the perfect luscious *summer* sherbet - stone fruit at its best.
Summer Shortcake: Arguably one of summer's best and most beloved desserts. While typically made with strawberries, we actually love this shortcake with raspberries – typical is not what we do, anyway. Our biscuits are fluffy, layered, salty and buttery and are perfect with fresh Hayton Farm raspberries, made into a jam, all resting in a coconut cream ice cream.Superbutter Blondie: An ooey-gooey almond butter ice cream with caramel swirls and pieces of chewy blondies. Adding to the magic, this ice cream is sweetened only with coconut sugar & maple syrup and has Moon Juice Vegan Collagen Protect superfood powder mixed throughout. Beauty in every bite!

Hello July!
Summer is here and we welcome it with open arms. Our seasonal flavors this month shine a light on pieces of magic that are happening all around us.Local leafy kale are abundant, juicy heirloom blueberries are ripe, and a lunar eclipse is happening on July 4th offering us an opportunity to lean into many  opportunities to grow and reflect. We hope these ice creams both inspire and nurture you this month. 
Blueberry Crisp: Shining a spotlight on one of our favorite summer berries : blueberries! For all you alt-sweet fans out there, we have sweetened this ice cream using just coconut sugar and maple syrup. From our neighbors to the north, we blend Bow Hill heirloom blueberries into our coconut-oat milk base and fold in perfectly crunchy clusters of a buckwheat cashew crisp. Eclipse: An eclipse is a dance of light and dark, an unveiling of the unexpected, and an opportunity to lean in and investigate. Our eclipse ice cream is a swirl of the brightest toasted coconut-oat ice cream with the darkest chocolate ice cream, both flavors harmonized with house-made sunflower butter cups covered in salty dark chocolate. We are excited to offer you this favorite flavor for a third time in honor of the Lunar Eclipse on July 4th. Kale Lime Leaf: Vegetables and ice cream is one of the founding principles of Frankie & Jo’s, and we love bringing this summer stunner back! We steep fragrant lime leaves in our coconut oat milk base and then blend in whole leaves of local organic lacinato kale from Ralph’s Greenhouse. A creamy yet refreshing summer cool-down. Eat your veggies!

First, an exciting shop update!
Our shops will be opening for normal service *scoops and cones* next Wednesday, June 3rd! For this first phase, our hours will be 2pm - 9pm, Wednesday through Sunday. It has been of utmost importance that our team create an environment in our shops where our customers and staff feel safe, so we have worked very hard to create a plan where that is possible. Follow our instagram as more details unfold over the next few days on what this looks like. Our shops will still be offering *pre ordering* for pints for those who would prefer contactless service or to guarantee their order. Read all about our NEW June flavors below! At Frankie & Jo’s, we love a bit of nostalgia and creating new traditions for you. To celebrate the reopening of our shops and our favorite season of the year, we created three seasonal ice creams that will surely remind you of childhood, but in classic F&J style, will also remind you it’s 2020. Aquafaba maple mallow fluff, chewy gluten-free chocolate chip cookies, and a coconut oat strawberry milk are just a few bits of magic we created for this month’s June flavor launch.
 

 
Cashew Milk & Cookies: Inspired by memories of dipping a gooey cookie into a glass of cold milk, we decided to make this nostalgic experience F&J approved. Heaps of soft, chewy Hot Cakes chocolate chip cookies are layered with gooey ribbons of dark chocolate sauce in our brown sugar vanilla ice cream.   Harvey Strawberry Milk: To celebrate Pride month, we brought back this beloved ice cream, one of the most popular F&J flavors for the third time in a row. Local, organic strawberries are blended into our coconut oat milk base, then sprinkled with chia seeds and swirled with house-made strawberry jam. We dedicate this flavor to Harvey Milk and all the incredible work & hope he brought to all people.  We are donating 5 % of sales of this flavor this month (2.5% to the Harvey Milk Foundation, 1.25% to the Neighborhood Farmers Market Alliance's Good Farmer Fund , and 1.25% to Seattle Farmers Market Association's Farm Relief Fund). Rocky Road: A new tradition of *rocky road* has just begun. This rich chocolate, coconut and cashew milk ice cream swirled with toasted walnuts and our own maple syrup aquafaba marshmallow fluff may quickly become your new favorite. Also, this ice cream is alternatively sweetened using coconut sugar and maple syrup.
*June seasonal flavors are available for nationwide shipping ordering today and in store scoops, waffles cones, pints Wednesday, June 3rd.* 



Let's be honest, we're all itching for a vacation.
So, of course we can’t help but dream of sitting with our toes in the warm sand on a beach in Mexico, exploring the dry deserts of Baja where agave and cacti fruit grows, wandering the bustling streets of villages in the mountains with smells of rich spices and produce wafting from market stalls, and the list can go on. Who’s with us? This month we give you three flavors that transport you there, thank us later.

 
Fresas con chocolate: Because who doesn’t love the combination of strawberries and chocolate? We blend plump California strawberries into our sweet and creamy coconut milk base. Flecks of 70% dark Theo chocolate are layered throughout making this flavor debut one of our simplest and most delicious creations to date.
Mexico Morning: Bringing back this fan favorite! Our take on dirty horchata ice cream, we steep Mexican coffee from Canyon Coffee and true cinnamon sticks in our coconut & cashew milk base. To finish, we swirl dulce de leche throughout and mix in the chewiest almond shortbread cookie chunks. 
Veracruz Vanilla: For this flavor, we wanted to shine light on vanilla’s native country of Mexico. Our co-owner Autumn Martin journeyed down to Veracruz to visit Gaya Foods, Mexico’s largest vanilla grower. We blend their vanilla beans and extract into our coconut milk base which is swirled with vanilla caramel & chunks of the chewiest brown sugar blondie pieces. 
Available right now for nationwide shipping here. 
Available for pint pick up and walk up ordering at both our shops in Seattle. 
 



What more could we need than *comfort and familiarity* 
during a time filled with so much uncertainty?! For this month's flavors, we will be bringing back three of our greatest hits from 2019. But first, a moment of honesty. Two weeks ago, we had three completely different flavors developed for you, but made a pivoting decision for this launch to have flavors you’ve enjoyed before. 



 CARAMEL COOKIE CRUNCH: A favorite from summer 2019, this rich and decadent caramel ice cream base has chewy, salty, chocolatey, crunchy potato chip cookie bites and a gooey caramel swirl. 
MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE: in collaboration with our co-owner, autumn martin’s other venture @getyourhotcakes, this is our version of their gooey molten chocolate cake. rich salty chocolate ice cream is layered with ribbons of magic shell, rose chocolate sauce and vegan molten cake pieces.  
SUPERBARK: this alternatively sweetened ice cream has chunks of our *superbark*, AKA a pumpkin seed and toasted millet dark chocolate bark, that adds a bit of crunchy bite to the creamy coconut sugar base.

All three flavors will be available in pints on our Frankie & Jo’s TO YOU home delivery service *only*. For nationwide delivery, place your order here. 



Hello, March!
A month in which the winter chill is melting away and the anticipation of longer days and new growth can’t come soon enough. Our flavors this month were created with this ebb & flow in mind showcasing the creamy, indulgent yet light and vibrant flavors of springtime.
 
 
Banana Chip: Feel refreshed with this scoop of sunshine. Sweetened only with maple syrup and coconut sugar, this luscious banana ice cream is made with coconut and cashew milk and swirled with our crunchy chocolate magic shell. A bit of sweetness & crunch in every bite. 
Mint Cookie Crunch: What is a better way to celebrate this transition from winter to spring than a decadent gooey, chocolatey, fresh mint ice cream?! This cashew and coconut milk ice cream is blended with fresh mint leaves, swirled with rich chocolate sauce, and finished with chocolate cookie crisps that are baked to perfection.
Rhubarb Yuzu Yogurt: Ridiculously creamy house-made fermented coconut yogurt is the star of this ice cream. The yogurt is blended with roasted bright pink stalks of rhubarb and tangy fresh yuzu juice. We can’t think of a better way to welcome lighter and longer days.
All flavors are available in our Seattle ice cream scoop shops and online for nationwide delivery, today through March 31.



For February, a month of celebrating love
and the transformational effect it has on us and those around us, we wanted to express the beauty and nourishment of self-care through our seasonal ice creams. To make this happen, we partnered with Sun Potion, a California based company that is dedicated to health, happiness, and well-being through the use of medicinal plants, superfoods, and tonic herbs. Within each ice cream flavor, we incorporate Sun Potion adaptogens to showcase and further our mission of creating a beautiful balance of mindful ingredients through sweet, plant-based indulgences. 
 
 
CHOCOLATE SPICY SUGARCOMB: In this rich 85% dark chocolate cashew and coconut milk ice cream, we add Sun Potion’s nourishing Reishi mushroom powder for immune support and stress relief. To keep things interesting, we swirl gooey cayenne sugarcomb candy throughout creating a subtle spice while still keepin’ things nice. 
TOCOCCINO: Rise & Shine! We introduce to you a creamy coffee ice cream that is sweetened only with coconut sugar and maple syrup. For an extra creamy boost, we add Sun Potion’s Tocos powder, a healthy source of Vitamin E, with swirls of dulce de leche and pieces of our house-made ground espresso bean chocolate bar.VELVET HEARTBEET: For this Frankie & Jo’s favorite, we open our hearts to this beautiful pink cashew and coconut ice cream made with roasted red beets and medicinal hawthorn berries. To finish, pieces of decadent chocolate ganache layer cake infused with Sun Potion’s Ashitaba powder, a rich source of vitamin B, are studded throughout. 
 
All flavors are now available online and in our Seattle scoop shops through March 4. 



It is a new year and a new decade, 
and what could be more exciting than giving you something they request month after month: more flavors that are cane-sugar free. We love creating products at Frankie & Jo’s that can be sweet, creamy, and satisfying while also a mindful choice for your body. 
So this month, all three seasonal flavors are made from alternative sweeteners: California dates, maple syrup, and coconut sugar. This may be our new favorite way to start the year.  
 
 
ALMOND BUTTER CUP:  For this ice cream, we are calling upon that classic and delicious combination of chocolate, almonds and orange. A creamy, rich chocolate ice cream sweetened with coconut sugar and maple syrup is laced with a hint of orange zest and blessed with perfectly rich, salty almond butter cups. MAPLE PECAN CRUNCH: We love the simple ingredient list of this ice cream. A maple syrup and coconut sugar-sweetened ice cream with lots of crunchy pecan and oat granola. 
RGE COOKIES & CREAM: It’s back for the month! Our creamy date shake ice cream swirled with dark chocolate magic shell and chunks of perfectly golden chocolate chip cookies. The deconstructed version of our famous ice cream sandwich collab with Rachael Devaux.
All three flavors are available starting today through the *end of the month* in our scoop shops and online.



We’ve welcomed December,
a time that is overflowing with tradition and magic by creating flavors that are our versions of classic holiday favorites: refreshing chocolate peppermint, perfectly spiced nog, and the sweetest pudding. It’s time to make new traditions and we’re here to help! 
  
 
CURED PERSIMMON PUDDING: Back for the third time, this butterscotch ice cream is our version of sticky toffee pudding. Perfectly ripe persimmons are hung in our kitchen for 6 weeks to cure (a technique called “Hoshigaki”, a Japanese style of drying persimmons). Once cured, these gems are cut up, baked into rich spiced cake pieces and folded throughout the ice cream with magical ribbons of gooey caramel. 
OATNOG: Frankie & Jo’s twist on that classic holiday drink! Meet your new favorite oat and coconut milk ice cream infused with cinnamon and nutmeg. The perfect accompaniment to your holiday desserts.

November always marks a season of celebration here at Frankie & Jo’s. 
Three years ago this month, we opened the doors of our very first scoop shop on Capitol Hill and we are still in awe of the obsession and dedication our plant magic community shows us. We are always committed to giving you mind-blowing flavors and this month our flavors showcase our favorite ways to celebrate. Plant-dyed sprinkles (what!) , ooey-gooey chocolate, and of course, lots of fluffy white cake.

 
HAPPY B-DAY: To celebrate our THIRD birthday, we created a sweet-like-summer strawberry coconut milk ice cream with chunks of fluffy gluten-free cake and swirls of strawberry jam throughout. To make it a party, we made our own white chocolate sprinkles that are dyed with plants: turmeric, spirulina, beet, and blueberry. MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE: In collaboration with our co-owner, Autumn Martin’s other venture Hot Cakes, this is our version of their gooey molten chocolate cake.  This irresistibly rich salty chocolate ice cream is layered with ribbons of magic shell, rose chocolate sauce and vegan molten cake pieces. A perfect way to kick off this holiday season! SPICED SQUASH: Harvest season is here, and we roast and beautifully spice butternut squash and create a creamy, coconut-sugar sweetened ice cream just for the occasion.   
 
All flavors are available today through December 3rd. Visit us at your local scoop shop or order pints online. 



All we can think about this month is...bread!
And not just any bread, but the best gluten-free sourdough bread we’ve ever eaten. Let us introduce one of our biggest inspirations and the creator of this bread, Seattle-based author and food stylist, Aran Goyoaga. To celebrate the release of her new cookbook, Cannelle et Vanille, our kitchen team used her recipe to bake many, many, loaves of this famous bread, and incorporated it into every single flavor this month. 
 

APRICOT TOAST: A cashew and coconut milk ice cream with swirls of the brightest apricot jam, made from summer’s last ripe apricots. Top your scoop with perfectly toasted gluten-free bread crumbs to reminisce on the joyous feeling of eating toast with a generous serving of your favorite jam.BREAD & CHOCOLATE: This is our version of a classic combination. We make a chocolate bar with pieces of toasted gluten-free bread soaked in olive oil and finished with sea salt. Chunks of this crunchy chocolate bar are mixed throughout a vanilla ice cream along with a swirl of extra virgin olive oil to finish.CINNAMON CRUNCH: This flavor screams nostalgia by reminiscing the flavor of that beloved crunchy cinnamon cereal (you know the one). A creamy cinnamon ice cream with crunchy clusters of toasted pecans and bread crumbs. You’ll come back wanting some more.
 
In case you didn’t get enough bread (but really is there ever enough?) you can find signed copies of Aran’s cookbook at each of our scoop shops while supplies last. With every purchase of Cannelle et Vanille made in our shops, you will receive a mini scoop on us. Cheers to a season slowed-down with baking, cooking, and ice cream eating!



As the days shorten and chilly breezes begin 
to rustle through the changing leaves, many of our daily patterns will also transition. To help ease ourselves into this natural season change, we give you our rich, buttery and oat-y September flavors.






Superbark: This ice cream is entirely sweetened with coconut sugar giving the base a delicate hint of caramel. Chunks of our *superbark*, a pumpkin seed and toasted millet dark chocolate bark, add a bit of crunchy bite to every scoop. 
Miso Moon: A Frankie & Jo’s favorite flavor. This creamy oat and coconut milk ice cream is abundant with ooey, gooey swirls of chickpea miso caramel AND perfect chunks of chickpea miso oat cookie crumble. The magical juxtaposition of sweet and savory in your scoop.  All The Trees: Autumn encapsulated in a scoop. Apple, pecan, bay, coconut, and cacao are all the trees represented in this Frankie & Jo’s fall favorite ice cream. A rich house-made apple butter is swirled into a bay leaf ice cream then sprinkled with “buttery” pecan shortbread cookies.

Don’t we all love a bit of nostalgia? 
Like the classic tri-colored Neapolitan ice cream, digging for the  cookie dough chunks in your favorite pint, & getting the biggest scoop of rocky road in a waffle cone?

Veracruz Vanilla: Some of you might remember the story we told last year of one of our co-owner’s, Autumn Martin, who journeyed down to Veracruz to visit Gaya Foods, Mexico’s largest vanilla grower. There she learned of the women - lead farm and how extremely delicate the process of harvesting vanilla is. We fell in love with Gaya foods and their vanilla so much we made an ice cream dedicated to them.

The arrival of Spring is here which means brighter and warmer days are upon us.
 To celebrate, we will indulge in the lighter side of the ice cream spectrum, creating two delicious sherbets and dropping the long-awaited release of our newest and most improved version of tahini chocolate. We will indulge in the benefits of superfoods like zingy fermentations of seasonal fruits & vegetables and the healthy rituals of adaptogens in our flavors this month - we can’t wait to see you!
 

 
Kombucha Creamsicle: We followed our gut on this flavor. Using Health-Ade’s small batch Blood Orange-Carrot- Ginger kombucha and galangal, a Thai-ginger root, we created a zingy probiotic sorbet which is then swirled with a sweet cream ice cream for the creamiest plant-based nostalgic treat!

Chocolate Tahini Supercookie: Introducing the long-waited improved tahini chocolate, now named Chocolate Tahini Supercookie! An ultra-creamy chocolatey tahini ice cream with swirls of rich chocolate sauce and generous chunks of our house made adaptogenic tahini super-cookie dough.
Rhubarb Yuzu Yogurt: We roast fresh, local rhubarb and blend it with a house-fermented coconut yogurt and fresh yuzu citrus juice to create a tangy, silky-smooth frozen yogurt.
All three flavors are available in scoops and pints starting today through the beginning of April at both scoop shops. They are also available for nationwide shipping, order your box today!
    


In the last month before spring, our February seasonals are all about getting warm and cozy with cookies, cake and candy made our way. 

Perfectly golden cane sugar-free chocolate chip cookies, gluten-free decadent ganache-covered cake, and spicy caramelized vegan sugarcomb candy are all three of the decadent inclusions in this month’s seasonals.  

 
RGE COOKIES + CREAM: Our creamy date shake ice cream swirled with dark chocolate magic shell and chunks of chewy chocolate chip cookies. The deconstructed version of the famous cane sugar, gluten, and soy free ice cream sandwich we created last year with beloved local registered dietitian, Rachael Devaux. CHOCOLATE SPICY SUGARCOMB: An 85% dark chocolate ice cream with a little kick from ribbons of sticky cayenne pepper sugarcomb folded throughout. VELVET HEARTBEET: This is our third year in a row bringing this February favorite back. We combine roasted red beets and medicinal hawthorn berries into a beautiful pink ice cream that is studded with pieces of rich chocolate ganache layer cake.

It's the start of another new year. Whether you are looking to cozy up by a fire with a pint, or resolved to get your health on, we've got you fully covered.  

 
SEATTLE FOG: One of our favorite warm winter beverages, the London Fog, churned into a cozy, creamy and bergamot-hinted ice cream. We infuse our coconut-cashew milk base fragrant earl grey tea from Pike Place Markets' Market Spice, one of our beloved local tea shops. 
ECLIPSE: An eclipse is a dance of light and dark, an unveiling of the unexpected, and an opportunity to lean in and investigate. Our eclipse ice cream is a swirl of the brightest toasted coconut ice cream with the darkest chocolate ice cream, both flavors harmonized with house-made sunflower butter cups covered in salty dark chocolate.
HEMP MATCHA CRUNCH: Hemp is part of the future. Our wildly creamy and earthy hemp-butter ice cream is infused with matcha tea, and sweetened with just maple syrup and dates (cane sugar-free!). We drizzle a silky swirl of date syrup throughout and layer with crunchy hemp seed super granola for that crunch we know you all love.

We are ringing in the holiday season with the return of three favorite F&J winter seasonals. 

GINGER & MOLASSES: A fresh ginger ice cream with chunks of gingerbread cookies and a generous layering of blackstrap molasses.  
CURED PERSIMMON PUDDING: Our friends at The London Plane source the ripest persimmon and turns them into Hoshigaki (a Japanese style of drying persimmons). We combine them in a dense spiced cake and then layer these pieces and ribbons of caramel into a butterscotch ice cream.
SOLSTICE: Inspired by this years solstice, we steep organic sage from Sage Wind Farms into a sea salt chocolate base. A soulful ice cream reminding us to look inward and reflect. 
All three flavors are available in scoops and pints starting today through the New Year at both scoop shops. They are also available for nationwide shipping, order your box today! 
 


Welcoming those chilly, foggy, & rainy days of November with three new incredibly rich, satisfying, & ultra comforting flavors.

 
MISO MOON: an insanely creamy oat milk ice cream with miso oat cookie crumbles and a gooey miso caramel sauce swirled throughout. It is a magical juxtaposition of sweet + savory in a scoop.
JAPANESE PUMPKIN: The return of a quintessential late autumn F&J flavor. A roasted kabocha squash ice cream that is perfectly spiced with cinnamon, ginger & nutmeg.
MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE: In celebration of our co-founder Autumn Martin’s other venture Hot Cakes 10th Anniversary, we brought back our version of their gooey molten chocolate cake. A rich salty chocolate ice cream layered with ribbons of magic shell, rose chocolate sauce and vegan molten cake pieces.
We recommend pairing this month's seasonals with our Dark Cocoa topping. And maybe a slice of a gluten-free, plant-based pumpkin pie on the side!


Think warm apple crisp, the gooiest caramel corn, and the best feeling ever of warming by a smokey fire. Welcome, autumn.

 
ALL THE TREES: Apples, pecans, bay, coconut, and cacao are all the trees represented in this ice cream. We make a rich house-made apple butter and swirl buttery pecan shortbread cookies throughout this bay leaf ice cream to perfectly *encapsulate autumn* in a scoop. HEIRLOOM BLACK POPCORN: We pop non-gmo Washington heirloom black popcorn and add it to our cashew and coconut milk base. fold in a beautiful golden dry burned caramel sauce and you have an ice cream that tastes *just* like the gooey and chewy caramel corn we all know and love. SMOKED FIG LEAF & CHOCOLATE: We cold-smoke fresh fig leaves for eight hours and then steep them in our coconut and cashew milk base. then we melt smoked chocolate into the base, candy oregon hazelnuts for added crunch, and swirl in a fig-balsamic caramel for a tangy yet extremely decadent ice cream!
 


We can’t let go of summer quite yet…so this month we created three flavors that are sophisticated yet playful.
 
 
SB&J: AKA sunflower seed butter & jelly! This is our take on the ubiquitous sweet & salty combo. We make a roasted sunflower seed butter coconut milk base, then swirl it with the gooiest marionberry tomatillo jam, and finally sprinkle in candied sunflower seeds for the perfect crunch! 
PEACH PLUM: We blend super ripe and seasonal Collins Family Orchard fortune plums and angelus peaches into our coconut milk base to create the perfect *end of summer* celebration in this stone fruit sherbet. 
PINK CLOUD: A collaboration with local vegan skincare company, Herbivore Botanicals. Playing off their PINK CLOUD moisture creme, we created a stunning swirled ice cream of one part white tea coconut cashew milk ice cream plus one part toasted coconut milk. We then fold in a house made fluffy vegan meringue that is lightly flavored with cardamom, rose petals, & vanilla and toss in sweetened coconut flakes.

Peak produce season is here! since being plant-based + vegetable-focused is *who we are* & always will be, THIS is the moment we’ve been waiting for all year.
 
         
FIRE-ROASTED CHOCOLATE ZUCCHINI: Our friends at Delancey fire-roasted zucchini in their wood-fired oven until perfectly blistered. the zucchini is then blended into our *naturally sweetened* coconut & cashew milk chocolate base with dark chocolate magic shell & pieces of moist zucchini cake.
FIELD & ORCHARD: We shuck the sweetest corn, cut it off the cob & blend it into our organic coconut milk. then, we bake the chewiest masa cornmeal blondie pieces to fold in with a house-made tart cherry-tarragon jam.
TOMATO MELON MINT: We take the sweetest watermelon from Alvarez organic farms and the juiciest heirloom tomatoes from Tonnemakers farm and blend them into our organic coconut milk base. To finish, we chiffonade fresh mint leaves & sprinkle throughout creating an insanely creamy & refreshing scoop.
 


For this month’s flavors, we wanted to express the essence of summer - plump juicy berries, the freshest greens, & sweet sunny days. So, we have created three flavors that - to us - exude just that.
        
Berries & Fermented Cream: A one part vegan creme fraiche ice cream made from our own fermented cashew milk plus one part triple organic Washington berry coconut milk ice cream swirled with our house-made berry jam & almond flour lemon cake pieces. 
Taro Root Sea Foam: We gently roast taro roots and blend them it into our coconut milk base. we then mix in house-made sea foam candy (an aerated caramel) and Theo Chocolate organic cocoa nibs. it’s ridiculously creamy, crunchy, and gooey.
Kale Lime Leaf: We steep fragrant lime leaves in our coconut milk base and then blend in whole leaves of organic lacinato kale from oxbow farms.
