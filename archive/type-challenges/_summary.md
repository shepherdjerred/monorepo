Project solves the Type Challenges catalog by implementing strongly typed utilities like `DeepReadonly`, `PromiseAll`, and `TupleToUnion` as TypeScript type definitions. It uses pure TypeScript configured by `archive/type-challenges/package.json` and `archive/type-challenges/tsconfig.json`, with the `typescript` dependency driving compile-time checking. All challenge files rely on shared assertion helpers in `archive/type-challenges/test-utils.ts` to validate each type solution at compile time.
