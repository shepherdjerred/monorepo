This project implements a grep-style command-line utility that scans files for lines containing a specified query. It is built in Rust (2018 edition) with only standard library components such as `std::env` and `std::fs`. Command-line parsing constructs a `Config` struct—including CASE_INSENSITIVE environment handling—that routes search operations through dedicated case-sensitive and case-insensitive functions.
