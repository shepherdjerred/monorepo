This project is a web application that uses a combination of frontend, backend, and scripting technologies. The "web" directory likely contains the frontend code (possibly using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks), while the "api" folder implements backend functionality, potentially with Node.js or Python for handling HTTP requests. The "scripts" directory stores utility or automation scripts, and "assets" holds static resources such as images or stylesheets.
