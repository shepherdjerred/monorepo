Docblocs is a document templating system that parses custom template syntax into an AST and renders it via context-aware helpers to dynamically generate server-side content. The core `@shepherdjerred/docblocs` package in `archive/docblocs/docblocs` is written in TypeScript and ships with tooling such as Mocha, Should, Supertest, and Typedoc, while companion packages like `express-docblocs`, `docblocs-demo`, and `docblocs-test` use Express 4 with Node/Nodemon setups to integrate the renderer into web apps. A notable design detail is the `bindTemplate` pipeline that curries template parameters into local or global scopes and resolves asynchronous helper output before returning the rendered bloc.
