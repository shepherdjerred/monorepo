File-matcher is a Python script that scans a directory and cross-references filenames against a provided list of strings to report matches, duplicates, and missing entries. The code runs as a CLI entrypoint in `src/__init__.py` and relies on Python’s standard library modules `os` and `os.path` to enumerate files and read the string list. Its `matcher.match` pipeline collects match statistics and prints comprehensive summaries, including duplicate string detection and files without matches, via reusable helper functions in `src/matcher.py`.
