This project appears to be an implementation related to concepts from category theory for programmers, as suggested by the included "cats4progs-DRAFT.pdf" document. The main source file, "main.hs," is written in Haskell, indicating the use of functional programming paradigms and Haskell-specific libraries or features. The project likely demonstrates or explores categorical abstractions, such as functors or monads, using Haskell as the primary language and illustrating theory from the accompanying PDF draft.
