Your typographic choices can help you display legible text, convey an information hierarchy, communicate important content, and express your brand or style.

#### Icons
**Path**: `data/hig/icons/index.html`

An effective icon is a graphic asset that expresses a single concept in ways people instantly understand.

#### Layout
**Path**: `data/hig/layout/index.html`

A consistent layout that adapts to various contexts makes your experience more approachable and helps people enjoy their favorite apps and games on all their devices.

#### Materials
**Path**: `data/hig/materials/index.html`

A material is a visual effect that creates a sense of depth, layering, and hierarchy between foreground and background elements.

#### Branding
**Path**: `data/hig/branding/index.html`

Apps and games express their unique brand identity in ways that make them instantly recognizable while feeling at home on the platform and giving people a consistent experience.

#### Dark Mode
**Path**: `data/hig/dark-mode/index.html`

Dark Mode is a systemwide appearance setting that uses a dark color palette to provide a comfortable viewing experience tailored for low-light environments.

#### Images
**Path**: `data/hig/images/index.html`

To make sure your artwork looks great on all devices you support, learn how the system displays content and how to deliver art at the appropriate scale factors.

### Accessibility & Inclusion

#### Accessibility
**Path**: `data/hig/accessibility/index.html`

Accessible user interfaces empower everyone to have a great experience with your app or game.

#### Inclusion
**Path**: `data/hig/inclusion/index.html`

Inclusive apps and games put people first by prioritizing respectful communication and presenting content and functionality in ways that everyone can access and understand.

### Common UI Components

#### Buttons
**Path**: `data/hig/buttons/index.html`

A button initiates an instantaneous action.

#### Menus
**Path**: `data/hig/menus/index.html`

A menu reveals its options when people interact with it, making it a space-efficient way to present commands in your app or game.

#### Alerts
**Path**: `data/hig/alerts/index.html`

An alert gives people critical information they need right away.

#### Sheets
**Path**: `data/hig/sheets/index.html`

A sheet helps people perform a scoped task that's closely related to their current context.

#### Lists and Tables
**Path**: `data/hig/lists-and-tables/index.html`

Lists and tables present data in one or more columns of rows.

#### Pickers
**Path**: `data/hig/pickers/index.html`

A picker displays one or more scrollable lists of distinct values that people can choose from.

#### Sliders
**Path**: `data/hig/sliders/index.html`

A slider is a horizontal track with a control, called a thumb, that people can adjust between a minimum and maximum value.

#### Toggles
**Path**: `data/hig/toggles/index.html`

A toggle lets people choose between a pair of opposing states, like on and off, using a different appearance to indicate each state.

#### Text Fields
**Path**: `data/hig/text-fields/index.html`

A text field is a rectangular area in which people enter or edit small, specific pieces of text.

### Design Patterns

#### Modality
**Path**: `data/hig/modality/index.html`

Modality is a design technique that presents content in a separate, dedicated mode that prevents interaction with the parent view and requires an explicit action to dismiss.

#### Navigation and Search
**Path**: `data/hig/navigation-and-search/index.html`

Help people navigate and find content efficiently.

#### Feedback
**Path**: `data/hig/feedback/index.html`

Feedback helps people know what's happening, discover what they can do next, understand the results of actions, and avoid mistakes.

#### Loading
**Path**: `data/hig/loading/index.html`

The best content-loading experience finishes before people become aware of it.

#### Settings
**Path**: `data/hig/settings/index.html`

People expect apps and games to just work, but they also appreciate having ways to customize the experience to fit their needs.

#### Onboarding
**Path**: `data/hig/onboarding/index.html`

Onboarding can help people get a quick start using your app or game.

### Platform-Specific Guidelines

#### Designing for iOS
**Path**: `data/hig/designing-for-ios/index.html`

#### Designing for iPadOS
**Path**: `data/hig/designing-for-ipados/index.html`

People value the power, mobility, and flexibility of iPad as they enjoy media, play games, perform detailed productivity tasks, and bring their creations to life.

#### Designing for macOS
**Path**: `data/hig/designing-for-macos/index.html`

People rely on the power, spaciousness, and flexibility of a Mac as they perform in-depth productivity tasks, view media or content, and play games, often using several apps at once.

#### Designing for tvOS
**Path**: `data/hig/designing-for-tvos/index.html`

People enjoy the vibrant content, immersive experiences, and streamlined interactions that tvOS delivers in media and games, as well as in fitness, education, and home utility apps.

#### Designing for visionOS
**Path**: `data/hig/designing-for-visionos/index.html`

When people wear Apple Vision Pro, they enter an infinite 3D space where they can engage with your app or game while staying connected to their surroundings.

#### Designing for watchOS
**Path**: `data/hig/designing-for-watchos/index.html`

## Search & Access Patterns

### List All Available Topics

```bash
# List all topic directories
ls packages/claude-plugin/data/hig/

# Count total topics
ls packages/claude-plugin/data/hig/ | wc -l

# Search for specific topics
ls packages/claude-plugin/data/hig/ | grep -i "button"
ls packages/claude-plugin/data/hig/ | grep -i "menu"
ls packages/claude-plugin/data/hig/ | grep -i "ios"
```

### Read Topic Metadata (Fast)

Extract title and description without reading full file:

```bash
# Get title
grep -oP '(?<=<title>)[^<]+' packages/claude-plugin/data/hig/buttons/index.html | head -1

# Get description
grep -oP '(?<=<meta name="description" content=")[^"]+' packages/claude-plugin/data/hig/buttons/index.html | head -1

# Get both
echo "Title:" && grep -oP '(?<=<title>)[^<]+' packages/claude-plugin/data/hig/buttons/index.html | head -1
echo "Description:" && grep -oP '(?<=<meta name="description" content=")[^"]+' packages/claude-plugin/data/hig/buttons/index.html | head -1
```

### Read Full Topic Content

For detailed guidance, read the complete HTML file:

```bash
# Read entire file (may be large - 50-250KB per file)
cat packages/claude-plugin/data/hig/buttons/index.html

# Read with Bash tool through Read tool (preferred for large files)
Read packages/claude-plugin/data/hig/buttons/index.html
```

### Search Across Multiple Topics

```bash
# Extract metadata from multiple related topics
for topic in buttons menus alerts sheets; do
  echo "=== $topic ==="
  grep -oP '(?<=<meta name="description" content=")[^"]+' packages/claude-plugin/data/hig/$topic/index.html
  echo ""
done

# Search for topics by category
ls packages/claude-plugin/data/hig/ | grep -E "(button|menu|alert|sheet)"
```
