Funsheet is a Java-backed web application that lets users catalog activities and search them by location, cost, types, and tags. It runs a Spark Framework REST API with HikariCP, FluentJDBC, Flyway, Jackson, Lombok, and a Vue front end using Vuex, Vue Router, Buefy, Vue Resource, and Fuse. The server supports swappable persistence via a MySQL-backed `MysqlStore` and an `InMemoryStore` seeded through `setupInMemoryStorage` and `createMockData` for development flexibility.
