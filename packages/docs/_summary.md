This monorepo centralizes active projects, learning efforts, and archived work under a Bun workspaces layout that standardizes commands across packages (`README.md:3`, `packages/docs/architecture/monorepo-structure.md:3`). Core tooling spans Bun scripts, TypeScript, Dagger, Tauri modules, and infrastructure stacks like cdk8s and OpenTofu, all declared in the root workspace manifest and architecture docs (`package.json:5`, `package.json:15`, `package.json:26`, `package.json:31`, `packages/docs/architecture/monorepo-structure.md:27`). Its Dagger-based CI pipeline splits Tier 0 checks into distinct Buildkite steps for granular visibility and shared caching on the serialized engine (`packages/docs/architecture/ci-pipeline.md:3`, `packages/docs/plans/buildkite.md:5`, `packages/docs/plans/buildkite.md:57`).
