This project is a collection of Jupyter notebooks and related resources for learning practical deep learning using the fastai library and PyTorch. It covers a range of topics including computer vision (MNIST, pet breeds classification, multicategory tasks), natural language processing, tabular data, collaborative filtering, and neural network architectures (such as ResNet and convolutions). The project includes environment setup files (requirements.txt, environment.yml) and is designed for hands-on learning with fastai, PyTorch, and Jupyter.
