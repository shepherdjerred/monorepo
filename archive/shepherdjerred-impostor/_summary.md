This project provides a set of source files for setting up and managing AWS infrastructure using a CloudFormation template, along with code for a Discord bot named ImpostorCord. The bot includes command handling logic, likely enabling users to interact with and control AWS cloud resources through Discord. The technologies used in the project include AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure-as-code and Discord.js (Node.js) for building and managing the Discord bot commands.
