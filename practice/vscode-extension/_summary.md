This project is a VS Code extension named test that activates to expose a `test.helloWorld` command which greets the user with an information message (`src/extension.ts`). It is implemented in TypeScript on top of the VS Code extensibility API with build tooling managed through the esbuild-based pipeline configured in `esbuild.js` and `tsconfig.json`. The extension architecture registers the command during activation and disposes it via `context.subscriptions`, ensuring lifecycle cleanup within the VS Code host.
