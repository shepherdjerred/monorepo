Maze is a console-based arcade game where you control an @ character with WASD to collect dots while evading ghosts. The codebase is a Java 8 Maven project that uses JLine for terminal rendering and Apache Commons Lang utilities. Its gameplay engine randomly instantiates MapObject subclasses for barriers, ghosts, and the player so each map and ghost configuration differs between runs.
