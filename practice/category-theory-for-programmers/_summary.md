This project appears to be a structured educational resource, with chapters organized as individual files that likely cover sequential topics or lessons. The presence of a README.md and LICENSE file suggests it is intended for open and collaborative use, possibly as an open-source textbook or course material. The technologies used are primarily plain text (or possibly Markdown) for content organization, focusing on accessibility and version control rather than on specific programming frameworks or languages.
