This project provides tools and scripts for training, encoding, and managing a language model, leveraging technologies such as PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and optionally distributed training with Horovod. It includes Docker support for containerized deployment, shell scripts for data preparation, and Python entrypoints for model training and inference. The codebase is modular, with core logic organized within the "src" directory, and is designed for extensibility and collaborative development.
