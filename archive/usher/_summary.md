This project, named "usher," is a web application built with React and styled using Bulma CSS framework. It utilizes libraries such as react-router (for routing), react-form (for form management), and react-json-pretty (for pretty-printing JSON). Additionally, it includes the "soap" package for SOAP web service interactions and sets up a service worker for potential offline support.
