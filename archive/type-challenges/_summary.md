This project is a collection of TypeScript utility type challenges, each implemented in its own TypeScript file. It leverages advanced TypeScript features such as conditional types, mapped types, inference, and template literal types to solve a variety of problems (e.g., manipulating tuples, strings, and object types). The project is purely TypeScript-based, as indicated by the package dependency and the file contents.
