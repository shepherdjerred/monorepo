Usher is a Create React App frontend that walks Harding students through checking, picking, and releasing chapel seats against the university’s seat assignment system. It runs on React 16 with React Router 4, HashRouter navigation, the node-soap client, react-form, and Bulma styling bundled via react-scripts. The interface centralizes shared Navbar/Wide/Narrow layouts and invokes SOAP operations such as PickSeat through `soap.createClient` to send the chapel seat payload.
