# impostorCord
[Impostor](https://github.com/impostor/Impostor) is a self hostable among us server that also has plugin support

ImpostorCord is a plugin for impostor that automatically mutes and unmutes players according to their state

## Usage
obviously you have to install impostor itself which requires .NET 5.0 which is currently in preview 

also make sure you download the beta (1.2.X) version NOT the stable version (1.1.0), the stable version has no plugin support yet

get the latest release from the releases page and put the contents of the zip in your impostor folder

this is what your direvctory should look like:<br>

├─ Impostor.Server(.exe)<br>
├─ config.impostorCord.json<br>
├─ config.json<br>
├─ libraries<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;└─(bunch of dependency files)<br>
└─ plugins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;└─ ImpostorCord.dll<br>

you also need a discord bot token and there are many guides on the internet about how to do that so im not gonna get in to it here

the permissions that we are gonna need are `mute members`, `deafen members` and  `send message` or put it on administrator but that's a bit risky if someone finds your token some bad stuff can happen to your discord server 

after doing all of those open `config.impostorCord.json` and put your bot token in the \<TOKEN> section

after all of that you should be able to start the server by opening Impostor.Server(.exe)

you can also optionally add all of the emojis in [emojis.zip](emojis.zip)

## Compiling
add the DSharpPlus SlimGet repo ([here is how](https://dsharpplus.github.io/articles/misc/nightly_builds.html))

if you are on linux you can just run the `build.sh` script like
```bash
./build.sh 
#or
./build.sh release
```
and it will create the files for you in `bin/<Debug\Release>/net5.0/publish/`, put those files in the root directory of your server (as explained in [usage](#Usage))

on windows assuming you are using the cli these are the commands you should run in order:

(`-c Release` in case you want to build the release version)
```cmd
dotnet restore
dotnet build (-c Release)
dotnet publish (-c Release)
```
