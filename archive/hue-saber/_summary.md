This project, "ideaprojects," is a Node.js application that leverages the node-hue-api library to control Philips Hue lights in response to Beat Saber game events received via WebSocket (ws). It uses dotenv for environment variable management and lowdb for storing configuration (such as Hue API credentials). The application auto-discovers Hue bridges, manages user authentication, and sets light states based on real-time Beat Saber data.
