Discord Plays Pokémon turns a Discord server into a cooperative controller for a Game Boy Advance emulator, letting the community drive Pokémon (or any supported ROM) together. The Bun-powered TypeScript monorepo includes an Express + Discord.js backend and a React/Vite + Tailwind frontend that exchange commands through Socket.IO with shared logic in @discord-plays-pokemon/common. A dedicated web interface streams keypresses straight to the emulator so players can bypass chat latency while still staying coordinated with Discord inputs.
