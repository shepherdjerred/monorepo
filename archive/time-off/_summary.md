This monorepo consolidates the author's active projects, learning experiments, and archived work into a single workspace documented in `README.md:3`. It runs on Bun-managed TypeScript workspaces with dependencies such as @tauri-apps/api, @dagger.io/dagger, and Lefthook defined in `package.json:1`. The automation script `scripts/run-package-script.ts:1` crawls every package to execute shared scripts with optional skip lists, keeping operations consistent across the repository.
