Monarch is an AI-powered pipeline that categorizes Monarch Money transactions by orchestrating Claude-driven classification, Amazon order reconciliation, Venmo note parsing, and Bilt rent splitting. The Bun-based TypeScript CLI leans on @anthropic-ai/sdk, playwright scraping, and zod validation to fetch transactions, scrape Amazon order history, and batch requests. Its modular architecture routes merchant-specific handlers—like Amazon cache-aware matching and Venmo CSV ingestion—into a unified apply flow that can run interactively or automatically.
