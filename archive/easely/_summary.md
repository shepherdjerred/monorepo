This project is a web-based application featuring a front end in the "web" directory, backend logic and endpoints in "api", and supporting code in "scripts". It uses web technologies (likely HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the interface, while backend API services (possibly Node.js or Python with RESTful routes) handle data and business logic. Script files support automation or build tasks, tying together front end and back end components.
