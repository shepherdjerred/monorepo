Huesaber synchronizes Philips Hue lights to live Beat Saber events so in-game actions trigger color changes around the player. It is built in Node.js using `ws` for Beat Saber’s HTTP Status websocket feed, `node-hue-api` for bridge control, and `lowdb` with the `FileSync` adapter for local state. The service persists the Hue bridge username in a JSON database so subsequent runs reuse the authenticated session without pressing the bridge button again.
