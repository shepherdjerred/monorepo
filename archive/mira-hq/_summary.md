Mira HQ is a full-stack platform for managing multiplayer servers, exposing GraphQL queries and mutations to list, create, launch, and stop game servers with owner tracking and uptime metadata. The stack combines a Next.js 10 React 17 frontend with Tailwind CSS and Apollo Client, a TypeScript Apollo Server backend on AWS Lambda wired to DynamoDB, and infrastructure defined with AWS CDK/monocdk for CloudFront, S3, API Gateway, and IAM. A shared `@mira-hq/model` package uses graphql-code-generator to produce typed schema, operations, and React hooks that keep client and backend contracts aligned.
