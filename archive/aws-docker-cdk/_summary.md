AWS Docker CDK provisions dedicated Minecraft and Factorio Docker game servers on AWS with configurable versions, memory, and routing settings defined in its primary stack (`archive/aws-docker-cdk/lib/aws-docker-cdk-stack.ts:1`). The project uses TypeScript with the `monocdk` AWS CDK distribution plus `aws-dlm`, coordinated by Node-based scripts such as `npm run cdk` and dependencies like `ts-node` and `typescript` (`archive/aws-docker-cdk/lib/aws-docker-cdk-stack.ts:1`, `archive/aws-docker-cdk/package.json:1`). A continuous delivery stack supplies an IAM deployment user and managed policy while the main stack automates EBS snapshot lifecycle management via AWS Data Lifecycle Manager, embedding operational guardrails into the architecture (`archive/aws-docker-cdk/lib/continuous-delivery-stack.ts:1`, `archive/aws-docker-cdk/lib/aws-docker-cdk-stack.ts:37`).
