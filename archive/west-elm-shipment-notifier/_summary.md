The project polls the West Elm order-tracking API every hour to detect shipment status changes and send email updates. It is built as an AWS SAM-deployed Python 3.8 Lambda that uses `requests` to call the tracking endpoint and `boto3` to publish notifications. A CloudWatch scheduled event wired with `cron(0 * * * ? *)` triggers the Lambda while a dedicated SNS topic carries both the customer alerts and failure alarms.
