title: Streambot web remote
description: Why Streambot's browser remote shares Discord identity and the existing playback actor.
---

The browser controls the voice channel's existing Streambot session while media continues playing in Discord.

The web API lives in the same Bun process as the command bot.
It calls the shared playback service rather than introducing a second queue or streaming connection.
The [playback service](https://github.com/shepherdjerred/monorepo/blob/main/packages/streambot/src/commands/playback-command-service.ts)
remains responsible for media selection, source blocking, and request history.
The [session manager](https://github.com/shepherdjerred/monorepo/blob/main/packages/streambot/src/session/session-manager.ts)
acquires a userbot only when playback begins.
Browsing alone does not consume one.

## Identity follows the viewer

Discord OAuth establishes the viewer's identity and shared servers.
Every media request checks current membership again.
Every playback action uses the viewer's current voice channel from the bot's gateway state.
Client-supplied user identities cannot authorize an action.

The web remote gives everyone currently in that voice channel shared control.
Its authorization adapter retains the real requester when adding media.
Existing slash, card, and voice permissions retain their defaults in
the [shared controls](https://github.com/shepherdjerred/monorepo/blob/main/packages/streambot/src/commands/playback-controls.ts).

## A page can become stale

A queue position has meaning only within the session revision the viewer saw.
Actions include that revision and the voice-channel identity.
The server rechecks both after asynchronous media resolution and before dispatch.
A changed queue or voice channel produces a refreshable conflict instead of controlling a different item.

Subtitle choices refer to tracks actually enumerated from the current source.
They expire and are bound to the viewer, source, and revision.
Choosing one restarts playback at the current position.
The browser receives opaque references rather than local paths or ffmpeg inputs.

## Discovery shares media metadata

Library, queue, and player images use TMDB posters with the existing server-side credential.
Episodes use their series poster. Lookups are lazy and shared per title, so artwork
does not delay browsing or playback. YouTube search results carry their provider thumbnails.
Only supported public image CDNs can reach the browser; local paths and credentials stay on the server.
TMDB attribution appears in the remote's artwork credits.

The Live sports tab uses the existing StreamEast and TVSportsLive catalog.
Its event selections are short-lived and bound to the viewer.
Upcoming games remain visible but cannot be queued. Live selections enter the shared
playback service, which checks the sports gate and resolves the provider's stream.
Queued sports retain the stable event page so playback can refresh expiring stream URLs.
Live sports retain their existing playback control restrictions.

## The edge serves the remote

The frontend is built into the Streambot image.
The media namespace exposes a separate web Service through the shared Cloudflare tunnel.
Metrics remain on their own internal Service in the
[Streambot deployment](https://github.com/shepherdjerred/monorepo/blob/main/packages/homelab/src/cdk8s/src/resources/streambot/streambot.ts).
Credential bootstrap is deliberate so missing OAuth credentials cannot break an existing Discord-only deployment.
