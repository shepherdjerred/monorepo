This monorepo collects personal active projects, learning exercises, and archived work under a shared workspace described in `README.md:1`. Its toolchain runs on a Bun-managed TypeScript workspace with Lefthook git hooks, Dagger’s TypeScript SDK, and Tauri APIs declared in `package.json:1`. The automation script `scripts/run-package-script.ts:1` traverses every package subdirectory and executes the requested Bun script while respecting an optional `SKIP_PACKAGES` skip list.
