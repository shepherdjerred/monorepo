This project is a Rust-based implementation of DNS message structures using the packed_struct crate for bit-level struct packing. It defines strongly-typed representations of DNS message components such as the header and question sections, with explicit control over bitfields and endianness to match DNS protocol specifications. The project is set up for further development of DNS packet parsing and serialization.
