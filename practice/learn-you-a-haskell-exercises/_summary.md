This project is a Haskell-based set of programming exercises configured with Stack, as indicated by the presence of stack.yaml and related files. It uses the Cabal build system (exercises.cabal and package.yaml) for package management and includes both source code (src) and tests (test) organized in standard Haskell project structure. The project is likely intended for learning or practicing Haskell, as suggested by the README and file organization.
