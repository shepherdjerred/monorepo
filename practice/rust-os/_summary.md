This project is a bare-metal operating system written in Rust that targets x86_64 hardware. It relies on the `bootloader`, `x86_64`, `lazy_static`, `spin`, and `uart_16550` crates to configure the kernel runtime, interrupt tables, and serial console. The architecture includes a custom serial-backed test runner and a double-fault handler that uses a dedicated interrupt stack table for resilience.
