- I work at Pinterest. Pinterest Inc transactions are my W-2 payroll income.
- Charles Schwab manages my Pinterest RSUs. Schwab transactions involving Pinterest stock are investments/RSU income.
- I pay rent AND utilities through Bilt. Bilt transactions should be split between Rent and Utilities if possible, or categorized as Rent.
- "Plan Contribution" is a 401K contribution — partially from me, partially employer match from Pinterest.
- Piedmont is a coffee shop, not medical.
