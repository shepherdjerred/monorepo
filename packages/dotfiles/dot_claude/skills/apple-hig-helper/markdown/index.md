# Human Interface Guidelines

The HIG contains guidance and best practices that can help you design a great experience for any Apple platform.

As you design interfaces for Apple platforms, keep these principles in mind:

Those three elements are set atop a larger rounded square.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/214efefd347927407f3273dedbd8df7f/homepage-establish-hierarchy%402x.png)

#### [Hierarchy](/design/human-interface-guidelines#Hierarchy)

Establish a clear visual hierarchy where controls and interface elements elevate and distinguish the content beneath them.

#### [Harmony](/design/human-interface-guidelines#Harmony)

Align with the concentric design of the hardware and software to create harmony between interface elements, system experiences, and devices.

#### [Consistency](/design/human-interface-guidelines#Consistency)

Adopt platform conventions to maintain a consistent design that continuously adapts across window sizes and displays.
