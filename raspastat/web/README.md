[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ShepherdJerred/raspastat-web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ShepherdJerred/raspastat-web)

Web interface for the raspastat-core module. Built with the Spark Framework and React. Provides a basic interface for viewing the weather, and changing the temperature of a raspastat.

Apologies for the photo of a screen, it's the only picture of the interface that I have
