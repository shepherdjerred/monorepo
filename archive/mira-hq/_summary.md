This project is a full-stack web application with a modular architecture comprising frontend, backend, model, and infrastructure components. The frontend is likely built using a modern JavaScript framework, while the backend handles API requests, business logic, and integrates with a separate model layer, possibly involving machine learning or data processing. The infrastructure directory contains configuration and deployment scripts, enabling scalable and efficient deployment of the application.
