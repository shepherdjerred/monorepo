Homelab provisions and manages a Kubernetes-driven personal infrastructure cluster named `torvalds`, delivering fully automated deployments and backups through ArgoCD orchestration. The repo uses TypeScript with cdk8s built and bundled by Bun, paired with Talos control-plane scripts and generated Helm chart typings under `src/cdk8s/generated/helm`. It enforces an ArgoCD app-of-apps architecture with dependency pinning and automated updates that keep Docker images, Helm charts, and Bun packages current.
