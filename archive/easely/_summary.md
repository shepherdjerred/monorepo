This project delivers an Easely API service that exposes assignment, course, and user endpoints via Spark Java routing. It is implemented in Java with Spark, Jackson, HikariCP, Redisson, MySQL storage components, and Log4j2 logging. The core data flow layers a Redisson-backed cache and cached scraper on top of configurable data sources, initialized through environment-driven `EaselyConfig` and `EnvVarEaselyConfig` components.
