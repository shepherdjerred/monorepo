bun-decompile extracts and de-minifies Bun-compiled executables, retrieving their bundled module graph and sourcemaps to recover original sources. It targets the Bun runtime with TypeScript tooling and leans on Babel, OpenAI, and Anthropic SDKs defined in `package.json`. Its AI de-minification pipeline combines call-graph analysis with Babel scope renaming to guarantee the renamed code remains functionally equivalent.
