@shepherdjerred/tools is a TypeScript CLI that fetches and formats operational data from Bugsink, PagerDuty, and GitHub to streamline incident response workflows. The codebase runs on the Node.js toolchain defined in package.json, compiles TypeScript sources, and brings in the zod validation library. Command modules in src/commands—such as pr/health.ts—share formatter utilities to deliver modular features like PR health checks that bundle merge-conflict detection with CI status aggregation.
