This project is a command-line utility written in Rust that provides grep-like text searching functionality. It uses Rust's standard library for argument parsing and error handling, and is organized with a modular structure, suggesting functions for configuration parsing and search logic are separated (such as parse_config and run). The tool is built for the 2018 edition of Rust and is intended to be invoked from the terminal, making it a lightweight and portable text search solution.
