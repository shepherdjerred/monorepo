This project runs AWS Lambda functions that bridge a Telegram chatbot to an Amazon SageMaker inference endpoint. It uses boto3’s `runtime.sagemaker` client, the python-telegram-bot library, and AWS SAM templates (`template.yml`) to wire the deployment. The architecture routes Telegram webhook events through a Lambda handler that calls a dedicated SageMaker-invoking Lambda, enabling conversational responses powered by the model endpoint.
