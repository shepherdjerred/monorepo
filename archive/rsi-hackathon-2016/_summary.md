This hackathon project delivers a redesigned Rural Sourcing Inc. website packaged as a runnable Java jar that spins up a local web server. It is built with the Java Spark web framework, Thymeleaf templates, Pure.css styling, and custom JavaScript modules for navigation toggles and management popups. The server listens on port 8080, serves static assets from `/assets`, and renders pages like `index`, `company`, and `management` via a shared ThymeleafTemplateEngine.
