# RSI Hackathon 2016
This is our first-place winning project for the Rural Sourcing Inc. Hackathon in Jonesboro, AR.

It's a simple redesign of their past website, images belong to the respective owners. The requirements and final product can be found under releases, the .jar file is runnable, and will startup a web server which can be accessed through a web browser. We had four hours to create this.

The project uses the Pure.css CSS framework, the Java Spark web framework, and the Thymeleaf HTML templating engine.

Our team consisted of
 * Jerred Shepherd (Created website)
 * Adam Campbell (Presented)
 * Christian Ellison (Extracted content from old site)
