Jukebox is a Rust music controller that maps numeric selections to specific Spotify track IDs and triggers playback routines for connected speakers. It relies on crates such as `rspotify`, `sonos`, `tokio`, `serde`, and `toml` to handle Spotify OAuth, Sonos integration, async execution, and credential parsing. The entrypoint loads credentials from `secrets.toml`, converts them into strongly typed structs, and routes the chosen track through a static device map to keep multi-device playback wiring centralized.
