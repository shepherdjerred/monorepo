This project is an educational operating system framework focused on teaching core OS concepts, using C as the primary programming language. It covers multithreaded programming (threads, locks, semaphores, lottery scheduling), CPU scheduling, and in-depth file system implementations (including RAID, FFS, LFS, disk management, and file integrity). The project also includes virtual memory components such as paging, small table management, and advanced physical memory policies, along with support for a distributed file system (AFS).
