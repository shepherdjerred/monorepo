Push Pal provides hosted continuous integration for self-hosted infrastructure, exposing a dashboard to review deployment sites and their stage revisions. The codebase uses a React 18 + TypeScript frontend scaffolded with Vite, integrates Supabase for GitHub OAuth, and publishes documentation through Astro Starlight assets. The UI computes when a main stage revision diverges from prod and conditionally renders a promote action so teams only advance builds when a newer revision exists.
