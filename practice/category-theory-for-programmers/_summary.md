This monorepo consolidates active projects, experiments, and archived work under a single workspace with shared tooling. It runs on a Bun-managed TypeScript stack with repo-wide `package.json:1`, Lefthook hooks (`lefthook.yml:1`), a Dagger pipeline (`dagger.json:1`), and Tauri API dependencies that automate builds and desktop integrations. A notable capability is the automation script at `scripts/run-package-script.ts:1`, which enumerates packages and executes targeted scripts across the workspace while honoring skip lists for selective execution.
