# The Storm

The Paper plugin behind [The Storm](https://ts-mc.net), a community and economy
Minecraft server (originally 2014–2017, revived on the homelab's
`minecraft-tsmc`). All gameplay code lives in one plugin, `TheStorm.jar`, built
from `plugin/`.

## Layout

| Path                               | What it is                                                                                                             |

## Commands

Gradle comes from mise (`.mise.toml`); there is no wrapper.

```bash
bunx turbo run build typecheck test lint --filter=@shepherdjerred/the-storm
cd packages/the-storm/plugin
mise exec -- gradle check                  # everything, including PMD and JaCoCo
mise exec -- gradle spotlessApply          # format
mise exec -- gradle :dist:runServer        # local Paper 26.2 with the plugin
mise exec -- gradle resolveAndLockAll --write-locks   # after changing dependencies
mise exec -- gradle --write-verification-metadata sha256 build
```

The jar is `plugin/dist/build/libs/TheStorm.jar`.

## Modules

Every module implements `StormModule` and is listed in `dist`'s `Modules`
(a test fails if one is missing). `plugins/TheStorm/config.yml` must name every
module under `modules:` with `true` or `false`; a missing or unknown key stops
the plugin. The repository owns that file; the plugin never writes it.

Inside a module, packages are layered:

| Package         | May use                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `domain`        | The JDK, core's `Result`, and its own module's `domain` and `app` value types. No Paper, Adventure, jOOQ, Jackson, JDBC, network or other modules |
| `app`           | Use cases and the ports other modules may call                                                                                                    |
| `adapter.paper` | Listeners and commands. Main thread only, so no JDBC, jOOQ, file or network I/O                                                                   |
| `adapter.db`    | jOOQ repositories over the module's own tables                                                                                                    |

Modules reach each other only through the other module's `app` package, and
schedule main-thread work only through `core.schedule.Scheduler`. ArchUnit
tests in `architecture/` enforce all of this.

## Quest content

The `quests` module reads authored quests, board templates, regions, factions,
and hooks from `server/owned/plugins/TheStorm/quests/`. Its runtime settings are
in `server/owned/plugins/TheStorm/quests.yml`. Content is validated against the
loaded Minecraft registries and NPC directory when the module starts; invalid
content stops startup with file and field errors. The objective, condition, and
action syntax is defined by `quests/domain/content/Dsl.java`.

`server/owned/plugins/TheStorm/collections.yml` defines 20 regional field notes.
The first eligible item pickup in the main world reveals each matching note,
saves its discovery time with quest state, and shows it in `/quests`.
The journal also lists the ten most recently completed authored quests with
their stored completion dates and summaries. Old completed quests remain in
SQLite even when they are outside that visible list.

Quest offers, commands, and progress are restricted to the configured main
world (`world`). Regions must resolve to that world's registry key. Board
draws keep a snapshot of their objective and reward data in SQLite so edits to
templates do not change quests already assigned to players. Shipped content
counts and references are checked when the quest module is built. Regional
chapters in `quests/regions/` cover Spawn Town, Sewers, Library, Caravan Road,
the main-world Wilds fringe, South Mines, the old Harbour, and Frost Falls.
The old sewer, water study, and caravan drafts inform their chapters. Enabled daily and
weekly slots require a template pool at module startup, and reward arithmetic
is checked before a board can be drawn. Boards turn over on player join or the
first quest interaction or journal view after the calendar boundary; the
recurring quest tick only rechecks objective progress.
Board and NPC offers use the same eligibility checks: prerequisites and repeat
cooldowns are evaluated against player state before an offer appears. NPC
dialogue gives story and track quests priority, then rotates offers of equal
priority in a stable order for each player and local day. Hand-ins and active
choices remain ahead of new offers.

Quest dialogue text may reference an Ink knot as `ink:<script>#<knot>`. Scripts
live under `quests/dialogue/` and compile at module enable; invalid scripts or
references stop startup. Ink currently renders text inside the existing NPC
dialogue graph. `quest_active(id)`, `quest_completed(id)`,
`quest_can_accept(id)`, `quest_variable(name)`, `quest_reputation(faction)`, and
`quest_points()` are read-only external functions over the current player's
main-world quest state. Quest buttons still invoke the quest engine's guarded
accept, hand-in, and choice actions. Ink snippets must end without Ink choices;
the authored quest statechart owns those buttons and their side effects.
Variable, reputation, and point values are exposed as decimal strings so
their full 64-bit values can be displayed; Ink scripts should not use them in
numeric expressions.
Scripts cannot use `INCLUDE`, so all source is auditable in one file.
Board template accept, decline and finish text can use Ink references. Board
offers retain the board's `{amount}` and `{target}` interpolation and reject
Ink references at startup.

Quest state and pending world actions commit in one SQLite transaction. Item
hand-ins run from that outbox after the state write succeeds, so a failed write
cannot remove items. Actions run in order while the player is in the main
world. Before an action touches Paper, its row moves to `IN_DOUBT`; the row is
removed only after the action reports success. A crash or ambiguous failure
leaves that row for staff to inspect, and later actions pause behind it.
Quest progression, completion reads, and the journal wait while an item hand-in
is outstanding, so the saved completion cannot unlock follow-up work early.
Crystal transfers use the outbox ID as the economy ledger's idempotency key;
these can resume safely after a crash. Paper inventory, teleports, spawns, and
custom hooks still need operator reconciliation after an ambiguous attempt.

Use `/quests admin effects <player-uuid>` to inspect the queue. For an
`IN_DOUBT` effect, inspect the player's inventory, crystal ledger, permissions,
or world state as appropriate. Use `/quests admin effect complete
<player-uuid> <effect-uuid>` only when the action took effect; use `/quests admin
effect retry <player-uuid> <effect-uuid>` only when it did not. Both commands
require `thestorm.quests.admin`. An item hand-in can remain pending if the
player leaves the main world or no longer has the items. Do not retry an
ambiguous action without checking its effect first.
Towns protection loads persisted claims before registering listeners. If a town
save fails, it reloads persisted state before accepting another change. If that
reload also fails, the server shuts down because its in-memory protection state
may no longer reflect stored claims. A denied join or respawn relocates only to
an already loaded, permitted location; when none exists, the player is
disconnected rather than triggering terrain generation in the arrival event.

The world module requires every world in `server/owned/plugins/TheStorm/world.yml`
to be provisioned and loaded before TheStorm enables. A missing world stops the
server rather than generating terrain during plugin startup. Keep the world
module disabled until an operator has provisioned `wilds` (large biomes),
`peaks` (amplified), and `mining` (normal), and confirmed their loaded names and
presets. The plugin checks the loaded name and NORMAL environment; Paper does
not expose reliable preset metadata for an existing world, so preset acceptance
remains an operator check. A mining reset must likewise make the replacement
world available before TheStorm enables again.

Towns separates land rights from container rights. Claims control building,
while a lock controls opening a lockable container on claimed land. New
containers lock for their placer. Unlocking removes the lock while claimed land
still applies its access rules. Owners can grant use, management, town sharing,
and redstone access separately. Admin
regions retain their own opening rules. Other modules use the towns
`Protection` port so their container interactions follow the same rules.

Town deletion commits a pending treasury payout in the same transaction as
removing the town and its claims. The treasury then pays the former owner with a
stable economy transfer key. If the server stops between these steps, towns
replays pending payouts on the next module start; a failed payout remains
recorded and is logged for recovery. Treasury deposits and withdrawals hold the
town busy until their transfers finish, so deletion cannot race a balance change.

## Conventions

The economy `Wallets` port supports a stable `KeyedTransfer` for compensating
payments. It stores the operation key with the ledger row, returns the same
receipt for an identical retry, and rejects reuse of the key with different
transfer details. `receiptFor` lets a caller reconcile an uncertain result.
Ordinary unkeyed transfers keep their existing behavior.

Paid random teleports save an attempt in the QoL database before their keyed
charge. The attempt remains until the teleport succeeds or a keyed refund is
committed. Module startup and player joins reconcile unfinished attempts against
the economy ledger. If a process stops after teleport delivery but before the
attempt is cleared, recovery may refund a delivered teleport; it never drops a
known charge without either delivery or compensation.
The cooldown is recorded before loading destination chunks, so a cancelled
warmup, failed search, or refused charge cannot repeat costly scans immediately.
The selected landing chunk has a reference-counted plugin ticket through the
warmup, charge, and teleport so the final move does not reload it on the main
thread.

Paid Essentials teleports use the same keyed ledger contract. Essentials writes
an attempt before charging and clears it after arrival and usage persistence or
after a keyed refund. On module startup, it checks each unfinished attempt
against the ledger and refunds any committed charge. If the process stops after
the player arrives but before confirmation is saved, recovery may refund that
delivered teleport. A failed recovery keeps Essentials teleports unavailable
until the ledger or database can be reconciled.

- `@NullMarked` on every package; NullAway (JSpecify mode) runs as an error.
- Error Prone with Picnic's checks; `-Xlint:all -Werror`. Warnings fail the build.
- google-java-format via Spotless; PMD enforces the repository's complexity
  limits (cognitive 15, cyclomatic 20, depth 4, at most 4 parameters).
- Expected failures return `Result`; exceptions mean a broken invariant.
- Config and content parse strictly into records with `StrictYaml`: unknown
  keys, missing properties and nulls are errors, and records validate
  themselves in compact constructors.
- Storage is one SQLite file. Each module owns
  `src/main/resources/db/migration/<module>/` and its own Flyway history
  table; modules that use SQL apply `storm.jooq-conventions` to generate typed
  jOOQ classes from those migrations. Writes go through
  `StormDatabase.write` (one writer thread); never block the main thread on a
  future.
- A skipped test fails the build. MockBukkit reports unimplemented Paper APIs
  as skips, so a skip proves nothing.
- Dependencies are locked (`gradle.lockfile`) and checksum-verified
  (`gradle/verification-metadata.xml`).
- Code copied from GPL/LGPL plugins keeps its license header.

## Grave recovery

The grave storage migration keeps the original V1 checksum. It refuses to run
while the old chest-based `qol_grave` table has rows, because those items live
only in world chests. Before enabling the new QoL module on an installation
that ran the old implementation, collect or expire those chests with the old
module and confirm the table is empty. The migration then creates the SQLite
item store without discarding any chest contents.

The QoL module stores grave stacks in SQLite. A death first saves a handoff in
the player's data with their emptied inventory, then creates the grave. Taking
items first reserves them in SQLite, saves the recipient's inventory and a
claim receipt to player data, then deletes the stored stacks. A restart or
rejoin reconciles unfinished handoffs.
If another death occurs before the first handoff settles, its items use vanilla
drops so the saved handoff cannot be overwritten.

Expired grave items and owner inventory overflow remain in SQLite as pending
ground drops. Tagged `ItemDisplay` entities are replaceable views; nearby
players collect them through the same saved receipt path. Overflow is owner
only until the grave expires, then anyone can collect it. Loaded chunks are
reconciled at startup and on chunk load. Interaction and nearby player movement
also trigger expiry in chunks that stay loaded. Collection pauses while QoL is
disabled; the stored stacks remain available when it starts again.
