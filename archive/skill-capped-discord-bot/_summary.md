Skill Capped Discord Bot is a TypeScript-powered Discord automation project that provides commands and services for servers. It leverages Discord.js, AWS CDK (`aws-cdk-lib`), and AWS SDK clients to build and deploy the bot infrastructure defined under `lib/`. A notable capability is the integrated AWS CDK deployment workflow (`cdk synth`, `cdk deploy`) that packages the bot and supporting resources for cloud provisioning.
