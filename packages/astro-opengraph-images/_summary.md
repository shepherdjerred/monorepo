This project ships an Astro integration that generates Open Graph images for every page in a static Astro build. It is written in TypeScript and relies on React-based presets powered by Satori and the @resvg/resvg-js renderer. During the astro:build:done hook it sanitizes HTML with jsdom, extracts Open Graph metadata, and renders customizable presets that cover Astro content collections.
