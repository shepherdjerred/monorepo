This project is a simple 2D game prototype built in Rust using the Bevy game engine (v0.6.0), with support for dynamic linking and random number generation via the rand crate. It implements a component-based ECS architecture with systems for player movement, rendering, health management, and a custom user interface, using Bevy’s scheduling, diagnostics plugins, and texture atlas support. The game initializes a 2D orthographic camera, loads a sprite sheet for the player character, and runs simulation and rendering logic at a fixed timestep.
