Project provides a command-line workflow to patch Berkeley Mono TTF fonts with Nerd Fonts glyphs, rename them, and optionally install or archive the results. It is implemented as a Python 3.10 script that uses fontTools, fontforge, and the Nerd Fonts FontPatcher fetched with `curl`. The pipeline caches the patcher in `~/.cache/nerd-fonts-patcher`, enforces consistent style naming through a filename-to-style map, and supports post-processing steps like zipping and installing fonts.
