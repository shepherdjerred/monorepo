This project is an infrastructure automation setup using Ansible, as indicated by the presence of ansible.cfg, various YAML playbooks (e.g., zeus.yml, hades.yml, dionysus.yml, main.yml), and supporting inventory files (inventory.yml, servers.yml). It leverages Ansible roles, group and host variable directories, and a requirements.yml for managing role dependencies, with secure vault handling via vault_password_file. The project is organized to manage and configure server environments following best practices for Ansible-based orchestration.
