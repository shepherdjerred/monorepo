mini-jam-98 is a Rust game project for the Mini Jam 98 Empty challenge, structured as a Bevy-powered application. It uses the Bevy 0.6.0 engine with dynamic linking and the rand 0.8.4 crate to drive its entity-component systems. The codebase defines granular components for enemies, health, inventory, and multi-directional movement states, enabling a modular ECS architecture for gameplay logic.
