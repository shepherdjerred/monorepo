This monorepo hosts Discord automation projects for a private server, including bots for karma, League of Legends match tracking with reports and leaderboards, music playback, and companion documentation sites. It runs on a Bun-managed TypeScript workspace with tooling like Dagger pipelines and Lefthook hooks declared in the root `package.json`. The repository is organized as a multi-package workspace under `packages/`, enabling shared builds and scripts across the various bots and front-end portals.
