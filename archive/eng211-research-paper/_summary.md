This project centers on the development and documentation of a scholarly paper using LaTeX, as evidenced by the use of .tex files (paper.tex, outline.tex) and a BibTeX bibliography file (bibliography.bib) for managing references. Complementary materials, such as a project proposal and an annotated bibliography provided as .docx documents, suggest a comprehensive academic workflow that leverages both LaTeX/BibTeX for technical writing and Microsoft Word for preliminary planning and resource annotation. The overall approach highlights an integration of typesetting technologies for academic research and writing.
