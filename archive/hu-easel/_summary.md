The project delivers a TypeScript backend for managing educational entities such as users, courses, and listings backed by a MySQL database. It relies on Node.js modules including `sequelize-typescript` for ORM, `loglevel` for diagnostics, and `ts-jest` for testing. A pluggable configuration layer (EnvConfig, HerokuConfig, SimpleConfig) switches between environment-specific credentials while bootstrapping Sequelize with the full model set.
