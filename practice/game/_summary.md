This project is a 2D game prototype built with Rust using the Bevy game engine (v0.8.1) and the bevy_rapier2d physics engine for robust 2D physics simulation. The codebase features core gameplay systems such as player movement and input, missile firing, enemy setup, screen boundary constraints, and weapon reloading, all structured using Bevy’s ECS (Entity-Component-System) framework. Rendering and physics debugging are facilitated by Bevy’s default plugins and the Rapier debug render plugin, targeting a fixed timestep for smooth gameplay.
