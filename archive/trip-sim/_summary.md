This project consists of two main components: a web frontend and an API backend. The **web** directory likely contains a frontend application built with a modern JavaScript framework (such as React, Vue, or Angular), enabling user interaction through a browser interface. The **api** directory contains a backend service, possibly implemented with technologies like Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, or another framework, providing data and business logic to the frontend via RESTful endpoints.
