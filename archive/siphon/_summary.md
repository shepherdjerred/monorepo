This project, "siphon-vue," is a Vue.js-based client application designed for the "siphon-web" platform. It uses a Node.js and Express server (as seen in index.js) to serve static frontend assets built into the "dist" directory. The development setup incorporates Babel for JavaScript transpilation and modern JavaScript features, as well as front-end tooling such as autoprefixer for CSS and autotrack for analytics.
