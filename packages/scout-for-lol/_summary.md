Scout for League of Legends is a Discord bot that tracks your friends’ matches and delivers post-game notifications with rich stat reports directly into your server. The codebase uses React, the Tauri app framework, Zod validation, ffmpeg-static, and both OpenAI and Google Generative AI SDKs (`package.json`). It runs configurable competitions, supports multi-region player tracking, and generates full arena-mode reports for all teams with augment and placement data.
