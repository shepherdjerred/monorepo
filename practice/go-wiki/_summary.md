This project implements a file-backed wiki web server that lets users view, edit, and save pages via HTTP routes. It is built in Go using the standard library packages `net/http`, `html/template`, and `regexp`, with templates under `html/` driving the UI. Pages persist as `.txt` files in `pages/`, and requests resolve page titles through regex-matched routes before rendering the appropriate template.
