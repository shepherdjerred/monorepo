This project is a fork of fastai/fastbook that captures the maintainer’s annotated progression through each fast.ai deep learning lesson in chapter-aligned Jupyter notebooks. It runs the notebooks with Python using fastai, PyTorch, and related tooling defined in `environment.yml` and `requirements.txt`, and can spin up in Google Colab through the badge in `README.md`. The repository organizes reusable helpers in `utils.py` and offers localized guides (`README_es.md`, `README_id.md`, `README_zh.md`) alongside chapter notebooks like `09_tabular.ipynb` and `16_accel_sgd.ipynb`.
