This project implements the Lox programming language interpreter from Crafting Interpreters, providing both REPL and script execution entry points. It is built in Java with a Maven `pom.xml`, leveraging the `com.shepherdjerred.jlox` package and Java IO/NIO utilities to scan, parse, and evaluate source code. Expression classes in `src/main/java/com/shepherdjerred/jlox/Expr.java` use a visitor pattern consumed by `Interpreter` to centralize evaluation across the AST.
