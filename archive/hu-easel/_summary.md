This project appears to be a web application structured with three main components: a frontend in the "web" directory, backend logic in the "api" directory, and supporting automation or build tools in "scripts." The frontend likely utilizes modern web technologies (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or a framework like React or Vue), while the API directory suggests a server-side backend, possibly using Node.js, Python, or another language/framework for handling requests and backend logic. The scripts directory contains utilities for tasks like deployment, setup, or testing automation.
