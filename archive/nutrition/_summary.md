This project renders a Nutrition Data report that tracks calories, macronutrients, body weight, basal metabolic rate, and exercise calories over time. It runs as a Quarto notebook (`index.qmd`) using Jupyter Python, pandas, and Plotly Express to read CSV exports from MyFitnessPal, Apple Health, and Strava. A notable workflow is the weekly aggregation pipeline that converts day-level logs into weekly averages, then applies the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to estimate TDEE and visualize calorie deficits.
