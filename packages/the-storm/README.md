# The Storm

The Paper plugin behind [The Storm](https://ts-mc.net), a community and economy
Minecraft server (originally 2014–2017, revived on the homelab's
`minecraft-tsmc`). All gameplay code lives in one plugin, `TheStorm.jar`, built
from `plugin/`.

## Layout

| Path                               | What it is                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plugin/`                          | Gradle build (Java 25, Paper API 26.2)                                                                                 |
| `plugin/core/`                     | Shared runtime: module contract, strict config parsing, `Result`, SQLite storage, the scheduler port, house text style |
| `plugin/modules/<name>/`           | One project per gameplay module (economy, towns, quests, ...)                                                          |
| `plugin/dist/`                     | Assembles the shaded `TheStorm.jar` and the plugin entry point                                                         |
| `plugin/architecture/`             | ArchUnit rules that enforce the layering below                                                                         |
| `plugin/build-logic/`              | Convention plugins: compiler strictness, formatting, PMD, tests, jOOQ codegen                                          |
| `plugin/gradle/libs.versions.toml` | Every dependency and plugin version                                                                                    |

## Commands

Gradle comes from mise (`.mise.toml`); there is no wrapper.

```bash
bunx turbo run build typecheck test lint --filter=@shepherdjerred/the-storm
cd packages/the-storm/plugin
mise exec -- gradle check                  # everything, including PMD and JaCoCo
mise exec -- gradle spotlessApply          # format
mise exec -- gradle :dist:runServer        # local Paper 26.2 with the plugin
mise exec -- gradle resolveAndLockAll --write-locks   # after changing dependencies
mise exec -- gradle --write-verification-metadata sha256 build
```

The jar is `plugin/dist/build/libs/TheStorm.jar`.

## Modules

Every module implements `StormModule` and is listed in `dist`'s `Modules`
(a test fails if one is missing). `plugins/TheStorm/config.yml` must name every
module under `modules:` with `true` or `false`; a missing or unknown key stops
the plugin. The repository owns that file; the plugin never writes it.

Inside a module, packages are layered:

| Package         | May use                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `domain`        | The JDK, core's `Result`, and its own module's `domain` and `app` value types. No Paper, Adventure, jOOQ, Jackson, JDBC, network or other modules |
| `app`           | Use cases and the ports other modules may call                                                                                                    |
| `adapter.paper` | Listeners and commands. Main thread only, so no JDBC, jOOQ, file or network I/O                                                                   |
| `adapter.db`    | jOOQ repositories over the module's own tables                                                                                                    |

Modules reach each other only through the other module's `app` package, and
schedule main-thread work only through `core.schedule.Scheduler`. ArchUnit
tests in `architecture/` enforce all of this.

## Conventions

- `@NullMarked` on every package; NullAway (JSpecify mode) runs as an error.
- Error Prone with Picnic's checks; `-Xlint:all -Werror`. Warnings fail the build.
- google-java-format via Spotless; PMD enforces the repository's complexity
  limits (cognitive 15, cyclomatic 20, depth 4, at most 4 parameters).
- Expected failures return `Result`; exceptions mean a broken invariant.
- Config and content parse strictly into records with `StrictYaml`: unknown
  keys, missing properties and nulls are errors, and records validate
  themselves in compact constructors.
- Storage is one SQLite file. Each module owns
  `src/main/resources/db/migration/<module>/` and its own Flyway history
  table; modules that use SQL apply `storm.jooq-conventions` to generate typed
  jOOQ classes from those migrations. Writes go through
  `StormDatabase.write` (one writer thread); never block the main thread on a
  future.
- A skipped test fails the build. MockBukkit reports unimplemented Paper APIs
  as skips, so a skip proves nothing.
- Dependencies are locked (`gradle.lockfile`) and checksum-verified
  (`gradle/verification-metadata.xml`).
- Code copied from GPL/LGPL plugins keeps its license header.
