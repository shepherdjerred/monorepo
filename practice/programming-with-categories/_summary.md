This monorepo gathers personal projects for experimentation and archiving across languages such as TypeScript and Haskell, keeping active and historical work in one workspace. It uses Bun-managed workspaces defined in `package.json`, pulls in desktop-focused dependencies like `@tauri-apps/api`, and includes examples such as `practice/programming-with-categories/main.hs`. A notable capability is the custom Bun runner in `scripts/run-package-script.ts` that crawls each package’s manifest and executes shared build or test scripts across the entire workspace automatically.
