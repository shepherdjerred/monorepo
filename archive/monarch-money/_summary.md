This project is a TypeScript-based toolset for analyzing and extracting subscription data from structured sources. It includes scripts to convert CSV files into a SQLite database, and to identify recurring and yearly subscriptions within the data. The solution leverages Node.js, the sqlite3 package, and efficient text and date processing to automate the analysis and reporting of subscription transactions.
