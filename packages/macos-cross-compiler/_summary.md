This project packages a macOS cross-compilation toolchain so Linux hosts can build C, C++, Fortran, and Rust binaries targeting macOS, ideal for CI pipelines. It relies on a Docker image configured with osxcross-based GCC, Clang, GFortran, and Zig (configurable via `mise.toml`) alongside bundled macOS SDK headers and libraries. The image mounts user source directories into `/workspace` and exposes architecture-specific targets like `aarch64-apple-darwin24-*`, enabling reproducible builds for arm64 and x86_64 macOS binaries.
