This repo powers the sjer.red personal site, delivering blog posts, curated bookmarks, and other content through Astro-driven static pages. It runs on Astro with plugins like @astrojs/mdx, @astrojs/rss, Tailwind CSS, and Node-based utilities such as `src/bookmarks/bookmarks.ts` that use jsdom and Zod to automate bookmark ingestion, giving the site an automated link curation pipeline.
