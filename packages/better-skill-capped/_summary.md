Better Skill Capped is a React web app that rebuilds Skill Capped’s catalog into a richer interface driven by the service’s embedded video manifest. It is built with TypeScript, Vite, Bulma styling, Font Awesome icons, Fuse.js search utilities, and Sentry monitoring. The UI persists bookmarks and viewing status through localStorage-backed datastores, giving users personalized tracking alongside the enhanced catalog view.
