This Rust project builds a 2D space shooter where player and enemy ships move and fire missiles inside defined world bounds. It runs on Bevy 0.8.1 with Rapier2D 0.17.0 for ECS-based rendering and physics, including sprite bundle assets and collider components. The architecture schedules gameplay logic on a fixed 1/60-second timestep and tags entities with bounds-tracking components to clamp movement and despawn objects that leave the arena.
