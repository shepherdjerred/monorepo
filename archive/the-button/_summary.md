This React Native mobile app connects to https://the-button-api.herokuapp.com/ to show a shared countdown and let users press a styled button while tracking connected peers in real time. It is built with React Native components, socket.io-client for the live socket connection, and react-test-renderer-backed tests living under app/__tests__. The App component maintains socket-driven state updates and delegates UI responsibilities to focused child components like app-button, app-progress, and app-users for clearer separation of concerns.
