This project, bun-decompile, is a CLI tool designed to extract and de-minify source code from executables compiled with the Bun JavaScript runtime. It leverages AI models—accessed via providers like OpenAI or Anthropic—to reconstruct and de-minify obfuscated or minified JavaScript, providing options for batch processing, API concurrency, and result caching. Key technologies include Bun, Babel for parsing and transforming code, the Anthropic AI/SDK for LLM integration, and a command-line interface for flexible operation.
