This monorepo consolidates active projects, learning experiments, and archived work into a single workspace with shared tooling and configuration. The root `package.json`, `bun.lock`, and `dagger.json` define a Bun-managed TypeScript stack that layers in Lefthook git hooks, Dagger CI pipelines, and Tauri API dependencies. A notable capability is the `scripts/run-package-script.ts` helper, which walks `packages/*`, honors skip lists, and executes any requested Bun script across every package for consistent orchestration.
