This project, named @shepherdjerred/a2ui-poc, is a proof-of-concept backend server built with TypeScript and uses the Hono framework to expose several API endpoints. It integrates with Anthropic's AI models and employs validation with Zod. The backend provides endpoints for health checks, topic exploration (streaming), and user action handling, and is intended to work alongside a separate frontend launched via Bun.
