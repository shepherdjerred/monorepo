This project runs a Claude web service that authenticates via GitHub and brokers agent sessions by streaming Docker container output to browser clients. The backend is written in TypeScript with Bun WebSockets, the Hono framework, Prisma, dockerode, jose, ws, and zod. An AgentProxy class relays NDJSON logs from container streams to WebSocket clients while token helpers XOR-encrypt stored GitHub access tokens with the JWT secret.
