This project, @shepherdjerred/birmel, is a TypeScript-based application that integrates with Discord to provide AI-powered message handling features. It uses the Mastra framework for core logic and observability, connects to a database (via Prisma and libsql), and incorporates OpenAI services for AI interactions. The architecture emphasizes observability (with OpenTelemetry and Sentry), scheduled tasks, and modular components supporting Discord event handling, memory management, and a music player.
