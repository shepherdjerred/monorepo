This project is a modular application structured with core logic in the `core` module, a CLI in the `cli` module, and a web interface in the `web` module. It leverages a monorepo architecture (`mono`), likely using shared concepts and assets across different components. Technologies suggested by the structure include a command-line tool, a web application (possibly with frameworks like React, Express, or similar), and core logic that is decoupled and reusable across interfaces.
