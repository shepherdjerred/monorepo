This project models road trip logistics in Python by simulating vehicle, lodging, and food costs for different group sizes and trip lengths. It uses plain Python modules under `api/src/model`, including an AWS Lambda handler in `api/src/aws/handler.py` for serverless execution. The driving simulator evaluates all valid vehicle combinations to pick the lowest total fuel and rental cost configuration for a given group size.
