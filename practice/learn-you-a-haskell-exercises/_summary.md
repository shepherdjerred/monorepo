Learn You a Haskell Exercises is a Haskell Stack project that implements the book’s chapter exercises, providing concrete practice functions such as list utilities defined in `practice/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises/src/StartingOut.hs:1`. It builds with Stack against the Stackage LTS 18.0 snapshot and depends on `base` and `random`, with tests discovered by `hspec-discover` as configured in `practice/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises/package.yaml:21`-`38` and `practice/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises/test/Spec.hs:1`. The source tree mirrors the book’s structure—modules like `FunctorsApplicativeFunctorsAndMonoids.hs` and `AFistfulOfMonads.hs` encapsulate chapter-specific solutions for targeted study (`practice/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises/src/FunctorsApplicativeFunctorsAndMonoids.hs:1`, `practice/learn-you-a-haskell-exercises/src/AFistfulOfMonads.hs:1`).
