This repository is a personal monorepo aggregating active projects, learning experiments, and archived work under a shared workspace `README.md:3`. It uses a Bun-powered TypeScript setup with declared workspaces, Lefthook git hooks, Dagger tooling, and Tauri API dependencies managed through `package.json:1`. A notable capability is the Bun automation script `scripts/run-package-script.ts:1`, which discovers every package under `packages/*` and executes a requested script across them while honoring skip lists for selective runs.
