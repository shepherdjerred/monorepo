Clauderon is a Rust-based session manager that runs isolated Claude Code or Codex sessions inside Docker containers or Kubernetes pods for secure AI development workflows. It is built with the Tokio async runtime, Clap for CLI parsing, Ratatui and Crossterm for terminal UIs, SQLx for SQLite persistence, and integrates Sentry-powered tracing to monitor errors. Claude, Codex, and Gemini agents share a CommonAgentLogic core in `src/agents` to keep their state detection and command orchestration consistent across the platform.
