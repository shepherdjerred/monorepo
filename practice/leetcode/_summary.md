This Maven-based Java 21 LeetCode practice module collects algorithmic solutions such as balancing shared expenses, generating count-and-say sequences, and composing target-matching arithmetic expressions in `src/main/java/sjer/red`. It leverages Java standard library constructs like `HashMap`, `PriorityQueue`, and recursive depth-first search, with `ExpressionAddOperators.solve` maintaining operand state to enumerate every valid expression that meets a target value.
