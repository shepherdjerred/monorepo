This project analyzes the 2020 R Community Survey, recreating milestone exercises that summarize and visualize respondent enjoyability scores, job categories, and related metrics. The codebase uses R Markdown with knitr plus tidyverse packages such as readr, dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2 to load, transform, and plot the survey data. Extension reporting consolidates the weekly milestones into `extension_4.Rmd`, merging country-level metrics, paginated tables, and multiple visualization variants under a single html_document theme.
