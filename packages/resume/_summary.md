Repository is a Bun-managed monorepo of personal tools and assets, including a LaTeX resume defined in `packages/resume/resume.tex` and other workspace packages registered in `package.json`. It uses Bun scripts with TypeScript, Lefthook, Dagger’s TypeScript SDK, and Tauri APIs declared in `package.json` for automation and desktop integrations. Build automation is centralized through Dagger configuration in `dagger.json`, enabling the shared scripts to orchestrate tasks across every workspace.
